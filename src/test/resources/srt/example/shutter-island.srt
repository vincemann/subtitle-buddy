1
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:16,450
Pull yourself together, Teddy.
Pull yourself together.

2
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,541
It's just water.

3
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,711
It's a lot of water.

4
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,046
A lot of...

5
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,676
Come on.

6
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,870
-You okay, boss?
-Yeah, I'm fine, I just...

7
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,749
I just can't... Can't stomach the water.

8
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,922
-You're my new partner.
-That's right.

9
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,009
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

10
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,138
Doesn't exactly square with
"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,"

11
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,682
-I'll give you that.
-The legend?

12
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,434
What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

13
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,896
Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

14
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,776
How long you been with the Marshals?

15
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,278
4 years.

16
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,198
So you know how small it is.

17
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,700
Sure.

18
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,704
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,789
I was.

20
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,261
She died.

21
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,223
-Jesus. I don't...
-Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,853
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work.

23
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,646
4 people died.

24
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,567
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

25
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm sorry, boss.

26
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,238
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,407
Here, have one of mine.

28
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,994
I could've sworn they were
in my jacket before I got on.

29
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,788
Government employees
will rob you blind.

30
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,459
Thanks.

31
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,254
They give you a briefing about
the institution before you left?

32
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:37,007
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,426
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,138
Well, if it's just folks running
around hearing voices

35
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,683
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,695
-Is that where we're headed?
-Yep.

37
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,573
The other side of the island
is rock bluffs

38
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,201
all the way down
to the edge of the water.

39
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,746
The dock, it's the only way on or off.

40
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,792
We'll be casting off
as soon as you two are ashore.

41
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,503
I'd appreciate it
if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,339
-Why?
-Storm's coming.

43
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,368
Never seen a Marshals badge before.

44
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,913
I'm Deputy Warden McPherson,
gentlemen.

45
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,164
Welcome to Shutter Island.

46
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,293
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,474
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

48
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,935
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

49
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,231
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,818
How can you tell?

51
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,738
I've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:37,187
All right. You gentlemen will be accorded
all the help we can give,

53
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,232
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

54
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,691
Is that understood?

55
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,151
Absolutely.

56
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,947
The red brick building on your right
is Ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,409
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

58
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,453
Ward C is that building on the bluffs.

59
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,122
An old Civil War fort.

60
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,624
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

61
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,626
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden

62
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,379
without the written consent
and physical presence

63
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,006
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

64
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,883
Is that understood?

65
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,262
You act like insanity is catching.

66
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,393
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

67
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,273
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

68
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,859
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

69
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,945
Executive order 319
of the Federal Code of Penitentiaries

70
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,072
states that when inside a penitentiary,

71
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,576
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

72
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,458
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

73
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,189
Okay. Now that the official stuff's done,
come on, boys,

74
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,232
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

75
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,955
When did she escape? This prisoner?

76
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,210
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have
to fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

77
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,420
Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

78
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,672
that's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

79
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,176
It's the only facility of its kind
in the U.S., even the world.

80
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,803
We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

81
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,847
ones no other hospital can manage.

82
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,849
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

83
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,851
He's created something
really unique here.

84
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,522
It's a hospital for people our society
normally considers beyond treatment.

85
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,390
<i>Top of his class at Johns Hopkins,
then Harvard...</i>

86
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,260
IDs, gentlemen.

87
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,890
Show your badges, gentlemen.

88
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,936
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times by Scotland Yard,

89
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,480
-MI5, the OSS...
-Why?

90
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,191
What do you mean?

91
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,779
What do intelligence agencies
want to consult a psychiatrist about?

92
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,156
I guess you'll have to ask him.

93
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,043
-Marshal Daniels.
-Doctor.

94
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,087
Marshal Aule.

95
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,257
Thank you, Deputy Warden.
That will be all.

96
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,010
Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

97
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,346
He had a lot to say about you.

98
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,641
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

99
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,019
And what would that be, exactly?

100
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,772
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

101
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,859
Pardon me, Doc.
A what between what and what?

102
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,869
Those paintings are quite accurate.

103
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,829
Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here

104
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,124
were shackled and left in their own filth.

105
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,500
They were beaten,

106
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,836
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

107
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,005
We drove screws into their brains,

108
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,925
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness

109
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,470
or even drowned.

110
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,513
-And now?
-We treat them.

111
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,807
Try to heal, try to cure.

112
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,517
And if that fails,
at least we provide them

113
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,854
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

114
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,191
These are all violent offenders, right?

115
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,526
I mean, they've hurt people.

116
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,031
-Murdered them in some cases.
-In almost all cases, yes.

117
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,949
Then, personally, Doctor,
I'd have to say,

118
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,410
screw their sense of calm.

119
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,749
It's my job to treat my patients,
not their victims. I'm not here to judge.

120
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,460
-So this female prisoner...
-Patient.

121
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,213
Excuse me. Patient,

122
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,805
one Rachel Solando,

123
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:18,385
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

124
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:22,389
-Last night between 10:00 and midnight.
-Is she considered dangerous?

125
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,101
You could say that.
She killed all 3 of her children.

126
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,896
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

127
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,274
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

128
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,236
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

129
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,656
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

130
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,742
And what about the husband?

131
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,538
He died on the beaches of Normandy.
She's a war widow.

132
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,582
She starved herself
when she first came here.

133
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,502
She insisted the children weren't dead.

134
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,098
Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen
to have an aspirin, do you?

135
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,934
-Prone to headaches, Marshal?
-Sometimes. But today,

136
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:11,980
-I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
-Dehydration.

137
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,857
-You all right, boss?
-Yeah.

138
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,651
In that case, you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

139
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,278
Thanks so much.

140
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,157
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

141
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,702
She also believes
this place is her home in the Berkshires.

142
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,081
-You're kidding me.
-She's never once in 2 years

143
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,833
acknowledged that she's
in an institution.

144
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,795
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

145
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,089
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

146
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,175
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

147
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,636
and she gives us all
parts to play in that fiction.

148
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,639
So have you searched the grounds yet?

149
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:49,309
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

150
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,894
Not a trace.

151
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:56,024
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

152
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:59,903
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

153
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,201
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

154
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,919
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

155
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,005
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

156
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,016
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

157
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,019
I mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

158
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,104
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

159
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,357
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

160
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,817
2 pairs.

161
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:43,154
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

162
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,116
So, she left here barefoot?

163
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,537
Come on, Doc,
she couldn't get 10 yards in that terrain.

164
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,206
Marshal?

165
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,227
This is definitely Rachel's handwriting.

166
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,146
I have no idea
what the law of four is, though.

167
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,066
-It's not a psychiatric term?
-I'm afraid not.

168
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,651
"Who is 67?"

169
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:23,987
Fuck if I know.

170
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,115
I have to say that's quite close
to my clinical conclusion.

171
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,909
Think it's just random scribblings?

172
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,746
No, not at all. Rachel's smart.
Brilliant, in fact.

173
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,248
This paper could be important.

174
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,209
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have to hold on to this.

175
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,669
Of course.

176
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,465
And you say she had to
come through here?

177
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,803
After lights out,
the orderlies play cards in here.

178
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,223
Last night, there were 7 men
sitting at the base of those stairs

179
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,766
playing stud poker.

180
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,895
Yet somehow,
Rachel managed to slip past them.

181
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,605
Why?

182
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,316
How? She turns invisible?

183
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,277
Doctor, we're gonna need access
to the personnel files

184
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,403
of all the medical staff.

185
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,281
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

186
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,491
We'll take your request
under consideration.

187
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:13,870
This is not a request, Doctor.

188
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,456
This is a federal facility,
and a dangerous prisoner...

189
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,750
-Patient.
-patient

190
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:21,127
has escaped. Now, you will comply or...

191
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,546
All I can say is I'll see what I can do.

192
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:28,593
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak
with the staff. Do you understand?

193
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,887
I'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

194
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,264
If you have any further questions,

195
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,643
feel free to join the deputy warden
in the search.

196
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,615
It's 11 miles
to the nearest land

197
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,408
and the water's freezing.

198
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,536
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

199
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,205
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

200
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,458
and her body would have
washed back up on shore.

201
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,673
What about those caves down there?
Have you checked them?

202
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,133
No way she could get there.

203
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,011
The bases of those cliffs
are covered in poison ivy,

204
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:16,140
live oak, sumac, a thousand plants
with thorns as big as my dick.

205
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,103
You said yourself, Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

206
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,111
All right, let's check the other side.

207
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,452
-What's that tower?
-It's an old lighthouse.

208
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,914
The guards already searched inside it.

209
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,043
What's in there? More patients?

210
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,254
Sewage treatment facility.

211
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,633
It's getting dark soon.
I'm calling this off for tonight.

212
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,260
Let's go, boys!

213
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,057
You were on watch
on the landing?

214
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,561
Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out
of their room on that corridor

215
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,396
without me seeing.

216
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,192
Okay, Rachel Solando, who else
does she have to pass to get down here?

217
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,076
Me. Glen Miga.

218
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,912
Sir, I didn't see nothing.

219
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,331
And you were at your post all night?

220
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,751
Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.

221
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:27,962
Glen.

222
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,798
Glen.

223
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,386
Tell me the truth.

224
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:37,805
I...

225
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,101
I maybe went to the bathroom.

226
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,271
What? You breached protocol. Christ...

227
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,690
I wasn't gone more than a minute.

228
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,777
All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

229
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,280
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

230
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,784
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

231
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,577
Anyone?

232
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,120
Come on, anyone, anyone,

233
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,371
anyone, anyone.

234
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,458
She was in a group therapy session.

235
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:08,777
Anything unusual occur?

236
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,255
Define "unusual."

237
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,799
Excuse me?

238
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:17,261
This is a mental institution, Marshal,
for the criminally insane.

239
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,305
Usual isn't a big part of our day.

240
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,975
I will rephrase.

241
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,979
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more,

242
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,565
let's say, I don't know,
memorable than...

243
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,400
-Normal?
-Exactly.

244
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,861
No. Sorry.

245
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,532
Did Miss Solando say anything
during group therapy?

246
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,701
She was worried about the rain.

247
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,037
And she hated the food here.

248
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,248
Complained constantly,

249
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,083
last night included.

250
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,587
So you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

251
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,007
Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

252
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,468
Dr. Sheehan?

253
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,513
Yes, he was running the session.

254
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,810
He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist
who directly oversees her care.

255
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,857
We're gonna need
to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

256
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:15,444
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.

257
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,865
His vacation was already planned.
He'd been putting it off too long.

258
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:23,703
You're in a state of lockdown,
a dangerous patient has escaped,

259
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,957
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

260
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,293
Well, of course. He's a doctor.

261
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,384
Do you have the phone number
for where he's gone?

262
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,220
Hello? Hello?

263
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,975
Hello? Anybody there?

264
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,353
I'm sorry, sir, but it's all down.
All the lines.

265
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,314
The storm's hitting the mainland
like a hammer.

266
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,357
If you get it working,
come find me immediately.

267
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,902
The marshals need to make
an important call.

268
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,320
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:03,367
Hello? Hello?

270
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,536
I'm afraid I have
evening rounds in the wards,

271
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,373
but I'll be having drinks and a cigar
at my house around 9:00,

272
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,459
if you'd care to drop by.

273
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,836
Good. We can talk then, right?

274
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,299
We have been talking, Marshal.

275
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,069
Gotta say, I'm thinking
I got in the wrong line of public service.

276
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,614
It is a little overwhelming.
It was constructed during the Civil War,

277
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,951
the same time as the military fort
housing Ward C.

278
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,293
This is the original
commander's quarters.

279
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,964
When Uncle Sam got the bill,
the commander was court-martialed.

280
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,091
I can see why.

281
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,718
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

282
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,679
No.

283
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,232
-It's Mahler.
-Quite right, Marshal.

284
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,945
Forgive me, gentlemen.
My colleague, Dr Jeremiah Naehring.

285
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,540
Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor.

286
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,670
Your poison, gentlemen?

287
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,589
-Rye, if you got it.
-Soda and ice, please. Thanks.

288
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:45,428
You don't indulge in alcohol?
I'm surprised.

289
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,433
Isn't it common
for men in your profession to imbibe?

290
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,769
Common enough. And yours?

291
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,564
I'm sorry?

292
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,525
-Your profession, Doctor. Psychiatry.
-Yes.

293
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,944
I always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

294
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,948
Not that I've noticed.

295
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,868
What's that?
Iced tea in your glass, there?

296
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,665
Excellent, Marshal. You have
outstanding defense mechanisms.

297
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,545
You must be quite adept
at interrogations.

298
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,015
Men like you are my specialty,
you know?

299
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,392
Men of violence.

300
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,353
Now that's a hell of an assumption
to make.

301
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,105
No assumption. No, not at all.
You misunderstand me.

302
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,192
I said you are men of violence.

303
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,403
I'm not accusing you
of being violent men.

304
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,488
That's quite different.

305
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,407
No, please. Please. Edify us, Doctor.

306
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,079
You both served overseas?

307
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,413
It's not much of a stretch, Doc.

308
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,000
For all you know,
we were both paper pushers over there.

309
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,543
No, you were not.

310
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,644
Since the schoolyard,

311
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,773
neither of you has ever walked away
from a physical conflict.

312
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,025
No, no, not because you enjoy it,

313
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,987
but because retreat isn't something
you consider an option.

314
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,906
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

315
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,410
Yes. "Raised."

316
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,539
And who raised you, Marshal?

317
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,207
Me?

318
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,743
Wolves.

319
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,549
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

320
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,735
Do you believe in God, Marshal?

321
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,868
No, I'm quite serious.

322
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,460
You ever seen a death camp, Doctor?

323
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,852
His English really is very good.

324
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,772
You hit the consonants
a tad hard, though.

325
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,525
You're a German?

326
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,736
Is legal immigration a crime, Marshal?

327
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,239
I don't know, Doctor. You tell us.

328
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,744
Now, listen. We're gonna need
those files on Sheehan

329
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,621
and the rest of the staff as well.

330
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,832
No personnel files will
be released to you. Period.

331
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,002
-We're gonna need those files.
-Out of the question.

332
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,555
Bullshit, out of the question! Bullshit!

333
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,633
Just who the hell's in charge here,
anyway,?

334
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,262
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison
to our Board of Overseers.

335
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,514
He relayed your request,
and it's been refused.

336
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,934
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse, and neither do you, sir.

337
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,729
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we'll do all we can to help.

338
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,398
This investigation is over.

339
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,775
We're gonna file our reports
and we're gonna hand it over to...

340
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,361
-Hoover's boys.
-Hoover's boys. That's right.

341
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:16,198
We'll be taking the ferry back
in the morning. Come on, Chuck.

342
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,208
Nice night.

343
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,217
You'll be bunking
in the orderlies' quarters.

344
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:51,066
Hey, boss. We really packing it in?

345
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,860
Why?

346
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:57,698
I guess... I don't know,
I just never really quit anything before.

347
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,951
We haven't heard the truth
once yet, Chuck.

348
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,289
Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out
of a locked cell, barefoot,

349
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,582
without any help.

350
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,668
I think she had a lot of help.

351
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,963
Maybe Cawley's sitting up
in his mansion right now

352
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,341
rethinking his whole attitude.

353
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,887
-Maybe, in the morning, we'll be...
-You're bluffing?

354
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,139
I didn't say that.

355
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,202
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

356
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,372
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

357
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,125
I killed a lot of people in the war.

358
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,754
Is that why you drink?

359
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,092
Are you real?

360
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,302
No.

361
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,974
She's still here.

362
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,976
Who?

363
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,312
Rachel?

364
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,190
She never left.

365
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:30,708
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer, Teddy?

366
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,210
We were so happy.

367
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,047
She's here.

368
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,091
You can't leave.

369
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,772
I'm not gonna leave.

370
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,025
I love you so much.

371
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,949
I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.

372
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,075
No.

373
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,036
I am.

374
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,833
You have to wake up.

375
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,211
I won't go.

376
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:18,797
You're here.

377
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,595
I'm not. You have to face that.

378
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,266
But she is.

379
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,895
So is he.

380
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,190
Who?

381
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,027
Laeddis.

382
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,658
-I have to go.
-No.

383
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:51,413
No, please. Please.
I need to hold on to you.

384
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,750
-Just a little bit longer, please.
-God, Teddy.

385
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,835
You have to let me go.

386
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,630
I can't.

387
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,413
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

388
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,962
Doctor!

389
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,172
Doctor, Doctor.

390
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:45,259
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

391
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,261
I thought your investigation was finished.

392
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,305
Well, it's not like we could take the ferry.

393
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,350
Now, was Rachel receiving
any other treatments for her illnesses?

394
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,564
Do you know the state of the mental
health field these days, gentlemen?

395
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,816
No, not a clue, Doctor.

396
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,234
War.

397
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,070
The old school believes
in surgical intervention.

398
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,655
Psychosurgery.

399
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,700
Procedures like
the transorbital lobotomy.

400
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,121
Some say the patients
become reasonable, docile.

401
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,498
Others say they become zombies.

402
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,750
-And the new school?
-Psychopharmacology.

403
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,086
A new drug has just been approved
called Thorazine,

404
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,339
which relaxes psychotic patients,
you could say tames them.

405
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,757
And which school are you, Doctor?

406
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:30,387
Me? I have this radical idea that
if you treat a patient with respect,

407
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:34,600
listen to him, try and understand,
you just might reach him.

408
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,897
Come on, Marge. It's okay.

409
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,483
-These patients?
-Even these.

410
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,986
What should be a last resort
is becoming a first response.

411
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,948
Give them a pill, put them in a corner,
it all goes away.

412
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,284
Rachel Solando was
on a combination of drugs

413
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,286
meant to keep her
from becoming violent,

414
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,456
but it was only intermittently effective.

415
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,166
The greatest obstacle to her recovery

416
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,210
was her refusal
to face what she had done.

417
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,212
"Was."

418
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:09,635
Is there a reason you keep referring
to your patient in the past tense, Doctor?

419
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,766
Look outside, Marshal.
Why do you think?

420
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,316
Next up is Peter Breene.

421
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,735
Assaulted his father's nurse
with broken glass.

422
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,364
Nurse survived,
but her face is permanently disfigured.

423
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,907
I can't wait.

424
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:36,103
She'd smile at me.
She was so sweet, but

425
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:38,163
you could see it in her eyes.

426
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,005
She liked to be naked,

427
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,625
to suck cock.

428
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,753
Okay, Mr. Breene.

429
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,799
And then she asked me
if she can have a glass of water?

430
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,052
Alone, in the kitchen,
like that's no big deal?

431
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,098
-Well, why was that a big deal?
-It was obvious.

432
00:32:56,182 --> 00:33:00,394
She wanted me to pull out my thing
so that she could laugh at it.

433
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,939
Mr. Breene.

434
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,110
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

435
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,531
When I cut her, she screamed.

436
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,450
But...

437
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,660
she scared me.

438
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,006
What did she expect?

439
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:21,656
Interesting.

440
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:26,086
But we're here
to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?

441
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,213
Rachel Solando. Do you...

442
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,549
Do you know that
she drowned her own kids?

443
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,759
She drowned her kids!

444
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,887
This is... This is a sick fucking world
we live in, I'll tell you that.

445
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,723
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

446
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:42,060
All of them.
The retards, the killers, the niggers.

447
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,771
You kill your own kid, gas the bitch.

448
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,985
Could you stop that?

449
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,905
-That nurse...
-Please, stop that.

450
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,075
That nurse, maybe she had kids?

451
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,412
A husband.

452
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,874
Just trying to make ends meet,

453
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,544
lead a normal life.

454
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,797
It says in your file that

455
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,342
you tore her face off. Didn't you?

456
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,803
Congratulations.

457
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,806
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

458
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,269
Do you know what she was afraid of?

459
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,106
You.

460
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,442
Could you stop that? Please?

461
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,820
Stop that!

462
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,114
Please! Stop!

463
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,366
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis? Do you?

464
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,659
No! No.

465
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,787
-Boss. What's up?
-Fine.

466
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,872
-I wanna go back. I wanna go.
-Peter!

467
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,584
Come on! I got him. Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

468
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,462
-Go back. I wanna go back.
-Come on, Peter.

469
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,671
-I don't wanna see him.
-Easy now.

470
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,549
-I don't wanna see him anymore.
-It's okay. It's all right.

471
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,392
I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.

472
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,730
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns...

473
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,566
-Mrs.
-Mrs. Kearns.

474
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,154
But you seem quite normal.

475
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,449
I mean, in comparison
to the other patients here.

476
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:23,161
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

477
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,958
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

478
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,671
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you

479
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:37,592
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

480
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:42,097
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

481
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,850
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

482
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:51,022
What would I do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore.

483
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:55,819
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

484
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,501
And what do you call them, televisions,

485
00:35:58,703 --> 00:36:01,641
voices and faces coming from a box.

486
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:04,210
I hear enough voices already.

487
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,622
What can you tell us about Rachel?

488
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,712
Not much. She keeps to herself.

489
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,215
She believed her kids were alive.

490
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,343
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

491
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:25,390
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen...

492
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,017
Deliverymen.

493
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,645
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

494
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,316
Yes. He talked about anger.

495
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,280
Tell me about him. What's he like?

496
00:36:42,608 --> 00:36:43,783
He's...

497
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,163
Okay. Nice.

498
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,958
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

499
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,215
-Did he ever make a pass at you?
-No.

500
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,677
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never...

501
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,350
Could I have a glass of water, please?

502
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,851
No problem.

503
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,035
-Thank you, Marshal.
-Sure.

504
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,125
I just have one more question
for you, Mrs. Kearns.

505
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,674
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

506
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,928
No.

507
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,973
Never heard of him.

508
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,063
She was coached.

509
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,233
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

510
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,736
-like she'd been told exactly what to say.
-Who's Andrew Laeddis?

511
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:10,662
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

512
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,961
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

513
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,921
We just met, Chuck.

514
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,925
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

515
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,430
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

516
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,642
I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

517
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,603
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

518
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,485
When this case came over the wires,

519
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,364
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

520
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:47,991
Why?

521
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,953
Andrew Laeddis,

522
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,956
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building

523
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,208
where my wife and I lived.

524
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,502
Okay.

525
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,381
He was also a firebug.

526
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,803
Andrew Laeddis lit the match

527
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,476
that caused the fire that killed my wife.

528
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,152
Let them out!

529
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:30,158
-What happened to Laeddis?
-He got away with it.

530
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,660
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

531
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,747
About a year ago, I open up the paper
and there he is.

532
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:40,335
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

533
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,880
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

534
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,092
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed 2 people,

535
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,927
said voices told him to do it.

536
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,638
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

537
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,932
-Then what?
-Then nothing.

538
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:57,769
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

539
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,230
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

540
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,606
Or he could be dead.

541
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,275
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

542
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,945
Lot of places to hide a body here.

543
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,657
Only one place
no one would really notice.

544
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:26,297
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

545
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,300
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

546
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,510
No.

547
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,721
Come on, boss.

548
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,144
She wrote it.

549
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,584
Boss!

550
00:40:56,207 --> 00:40:59,664
We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

551
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,000
-Hold on.
-No, let's go!

552
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,337
Watch out!

553
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,674
Jesus!

554
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,720
-Come on! Up there!
-Let's go!

555
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,349
Get in there! Let's go!

556
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,188
Boss!

557
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,322
-God!
-Jesus Christ!

558
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,617
Damn it. God!

559
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:47,587
-You okay, boss?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

560
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,679
So if Laeddis is here,

561
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,841
what are you gonna do about it?

562
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,187
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

563
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,697
If it was my wife, I'd kill him. Twice.

564
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:30,088
When we got through the gates at Dachau,
the SS guards surrendered.

565
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:43,002
The Kommandant tried to kill himself
before we got there, but

566
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:45,052
he...

567
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,813
He botched it.

568
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,358
Took him an hour to die.

569
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:59,200
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

570
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,373
Too many to count.

571
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,901
Too many to imagine.

572
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,239
So, yeah, the...

573
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,327
The guards surrendered,
we took their guns,

574
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,329
and we lined them up.

575
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,667
It wasn't warfare. It was...

576
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,212
It was murder.

577
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,635
Yeah, I've had enough of killing.

578
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,139
That's not why I'm here.

579
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,218
So what is this all about?

580
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,500
After Laeddis vanished,

581
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,650
I started doing some
checking on Ashecliffe.

582
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,738
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

583
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,323
You know, it's like it...

584
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,867
It's like they're scared or something.

585
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,914
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant

586
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,668
from The House
Un-American Activities Committee?

587
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,921
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists

588
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,340
from an island in Boston Harbor?

589
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,593
By conducting experiments on the mind.

590
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,471
At least that's my guess.

591
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,265
And you think that's going on here?

592
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,851
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

593
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:32,603
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

594
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:37,066
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

595
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,193
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

596
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,653
Guess what they were testing?

597
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,821
Toothpaste.

598
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,282
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

599
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,970
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe,

600
00:45:48,106 --> 00:45:49,570
Ward C.

601
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:53,499
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

602
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:58,504
2 weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs 3 men to death.

603
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:04,010
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he...

604
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:08,556
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

605
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,768
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

606
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,605
-And you found him.
-Yeah, I found him.

607
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,191
Well, he's a mess.

608
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,903
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

609
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,112
What?

610
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,239
They're experimenting on people here.

611
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,742
I don't know, boss.

612
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,288
-How do you believe a crazy guy?
-That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

613
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:36,626
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

614
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,878
I stood at Dachau.

615
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,800
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

616
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,469
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

617
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:51,432
and now... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil? No.

618
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,228
So what are you really here to do, Ted?

619
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,732
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

620
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,068
and I'm gonna blow the lid off this place.

621
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,111
That's it.

622
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,405
Wait a minute.

623
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,784
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

624
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,285
waiting for a chance to get out here,

625
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,955
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

626
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:17,917
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

627
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,003
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

628
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,755
The world doesn't work that way.

629
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,133
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

630
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,345
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

631
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:33,099
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

632
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:37,770
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

633
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,856
-What if they wanted you here?
-Bullshit.

634
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,066
-You were asking questions.
-Bullshit! Bullshit!

635
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,651
Bullshit. We came here
for Rachel Solando.

636
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,612
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

637
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,864
There's no way they could've known

638
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,323
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

639
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,743
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

640
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,038
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

641
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,915
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

642
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,505
<i>Marshals, are you out here?</i>

643
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,924
This is Deputy Warden McPherson.

644
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:08,676
Marshals!

645
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,761
How about that? They found us.

646
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,347
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

647
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,350
I know you're in there.

648
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:21,105
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

649
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,528
-Come on!
-Go, go!

650
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,458
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

651
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,629
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

652
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:54,138
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

653
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,016
That is, if we all don't wash away first.

654
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,562
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

655
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,314
So...

656
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,109
This is our only choice.

657
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,237
Got something really nice in
a prison gray if that don't work for you.

658
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,240
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

659
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:17,036
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all Ward C patients

660
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,372
be placed in manual restraints.

661
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,792
If the facility floods, they'll drown.
You know that.

662
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,502
That would take a lot of flooding.

663
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,544
We're on an island

664
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,254
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane.

665
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,007
A lot of flooding seems
like a distinct possibility.

666
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,426
It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

667
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,761
There's a backup generator.

668
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,555
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

669
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,351
Where are they going to go?

670
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,437
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

671
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,522
You're quite right.

672
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,775
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

673
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,612
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

674
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,823
This is 24 human beings.

675
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,783
And you can live with that, can you?

676
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,954
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B

677
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,372
in manual restraints as well.

678
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,333
-Excuse me! Excuse me.
-Marshal.

679
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,961
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

680
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,254
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.

681
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,340
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note...

682
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,134
"The law of four." I love that.

683
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:16,762
you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

684
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:22,184
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.
None of us do.

685
00:50:23,269 --> 00:50:25,137
Nothing comes to mind?

686
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,858
Nothing?

687
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:37,867
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C

688
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,411
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

689
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:43,956
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

690
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,625
That is correct, yes.

691
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,506
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting

692
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:56,385
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

693
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,388
But I'm afraid we don't.

694
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:01,932
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

695
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,185
We're doing our goddamn job.

696
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,188
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

697
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:10,191
No. What's the good news, Doctor?

698
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,610
Rachel's been found.

699
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:15,029
She's here.

700
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,698
Safe and sound.

701
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,420
There's not a mark on her.

702
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,467
Who are these men?

703
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,430
Why are they in my house?

704
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:46,018
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

705
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,731
Ma'am.

706
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:58,697
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

707
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,699
passing out literature.

708
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,702
Here?

709
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,540
In this neighborhood?

710
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,375
Yes, I'm afraid so.

711
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:14,338
Now if you could tell us what you did
yesterday, where you were,

712
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,549
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

713
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,226
Yes.

714
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,514
Well, I...

715
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:29,270
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

716
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,356
and then I

717
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,443
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

718
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,783
Then I sent the children off to school.

719
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,455
And then

720
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,923
I decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

721
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,015
I see.

722
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,270
And after that?

723
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,779
After that,

724
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,208
I thought of you.

725
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:42,176
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I don't know what you're talking about.

726
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,140
Don't you know
how lonely I've been, Jim?

727
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,189
You're gone.

728
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,903
You're dead.

729
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,826
I cry every night.

730
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,043
How am I supposed to survive?

731
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,712
God.

732
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,393
Rachel, it'll be all right.

733
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,690
I'm so sorry, but every...

734
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,236
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?

735
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,614
I buried you.

736
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,577
I buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down,

737
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:54,164
lumps of flesh splashing into the sea,
eaten by sharks.

738
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,046
My Jim's dead, so who the fuck are you?

739
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,135
Who the fuck are you?

740
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,012
-Who are you?
-Hey, hey, hey.

741
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,680
-Who are you?
-It's okay. Rachel. Rachel, it's all right.

742
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,266
Let me go! No!

743
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:16,061
-Rachel, it's okay.
-Look at me, look at me.

744
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,276
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't want to interrupt.

745
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,695
I thought she might tell you something.

746
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:28,699
We found her down by the lighthouse,
skipping stones.

747
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,951
We've no idea how she got out, but...

748
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,412
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

749
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,456
There's food, water and cots.

750
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,792
It's the safest place to be
when the hurricane hits.

751
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:45,299
Are you all right? You look pale.

752
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,176
I'm fine. It's just...

753
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,220
Boss, are you okay?

754
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,807
It's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?

755
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:58,228
Photosensitivity, headaches sometimes.
Marshal, are you having a migraine?

756
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,980
I'll be all right.

757
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,318
Come on, I got you.

758
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,738
What's wrong with him?

759
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:10,240
Take these, Marshal. Couple of hours,
you'll be as clear as a bell.

760
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,326
-What's wrong with him?
-He's having a migraine.

761
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,703
Imagine someone sawed open
your head, filled it with razors,

762
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,498
and shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, Marshal.

763
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,708
-I don't... I don't want the pills.
-It'll stop the pain.

764
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,710
Marshal, take the pills.

765
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,674
He's going to need to lie down.

766
00:56:33,248 --> 00:56:34,306
My God!

767
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,724
There's broken glass
all over the floor.

768
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,309
-Make sure all the meds are locked up.
-Watch your back.

769
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,477
Make sure everything's okay
in Ward B.

770
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,853
Go down to the infirmary and see

771
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,271
-if there's any more...
-All right, Doctor.

772
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:45,150
Give him a bed. This one here.

773
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,821
-Over here. All right, boss.
-Yeah, that's it.

774
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,988
-You have him?
-Yes.

775
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,157
Careful. All right.

776
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,869
Could be worse right now.
He'll be all right.

777
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,627
Who is that?

778
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,213
Him? That's the warden.

779
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:13,178
Don't you worry about him, all right?
Come on. Lay back. Lay back.

780
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,686
He looks like an ex-military prick.

781
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,729
Well, you know what?
I ain't gonna argue with you on that one.

782
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,485
You should have saved me.

783
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,781
You should have saved all of us.

784
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,770
Hey, buddy.

785
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,065
Hey.

786
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,441
Laeddis.

787
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,236
Yeah.

788
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:40,617
My...

789
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,206
My buddy.

790
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,668
No hard feelings, right?

791
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,673
Yeah.

792
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,884
No hard feelings.

793
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,525
A little something for later,

794
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,615
'cause I know how much you need it.

795
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:29,875
The clock's ticking, my friend.
We're running out of time.

796
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,471
Give me a hand here.

797
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,244
I could get into trouble.

798
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,982
I'm dead.

799
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,487
I'm so sorry.

800
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,157
Why didn't you save me?

801
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,559
I tried.

802
01:01:46,809 --> 01:01:50,789
I wanted to, but by the time
I got there, it was too late.

803
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,020
See?

804
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:19,192
Aren't they beautiful?

805
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,041
Why are you all wet, baby?

806
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,420
Laeddis isn't dead.

807
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,298
He isn't gone.

808
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,092
He's still here.

809
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,596
I know.

810
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,057
You need to find him, Teddy.

811
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,768
You need to find him
and you kill him dead.

812
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:53,912
It's okay.

813
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,716
-Security to Ward A. Okay.
-Ward A. I got it.

814
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,802
The generator room's flooded.

815
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:11,137
-Ward A. Ward A.
-See what we need in Ward B.

816
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,722
Let's go.

817
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,599
You okay, boss?

818
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:19,229
This goddamn migraine.

819
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:23,191
The backup generator's failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

820
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,194
What do you want to do?

821
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:35,579
-Christ.
-Dan? Relax. Nope, nope.

822
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:38,081
You don't wanna do that. Put it down.
Now. Put it down.

823
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:41,751
Grab him, grab him, grab him, grab him!
Get him, get him!

824
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:48,800
You need to go find him
'cause he needs to be here.

825
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,428
You think the whole electrical system
is fried?

826
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,264
I'd say it's a good possibility, yeah.

827
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:57,392
-All the electronic security, the fences...
-Why are you always running?

828
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:00,645
-the gates, the doors.
-Why is it you every time? Come on.

829
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,691
Nice day for a stroll, don't you think?
To Ward C, for example.

830
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:10,363
-Come on.
-Maybe we'll run into Andrew Laeddis.

831
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,330
The guy I told you about,
George Noyce?

832
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,124
He told me this is where
they keep the worst ones.

833
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,835
Guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

834
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,006
Did Noyce give you anything
on the layout?

835
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:31,843
Not really. All he remembered was
people screaming day and night,

836
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,638
no windows and iron bars everywhere.

837
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:35,889
Watch your head!

838
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,203
-Jesus Christ!
-Jesus.

839
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,538
First time on Ward C?

840
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,291
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

841
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,417
We heard stories, but...

842
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,128
Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit.

843
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,756
We got most of the bugsies
locked down now,

844
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,008
but some of them are still loose.

845
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,803
And if you see one,
don't try to restrain him yourselves.

846
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,263
These fuckers will kill you. Clear?

847
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:21,267
All right, get your asses moving then.
Go on.

848
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,325
He's here.

849
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,750
Laeddis. I can feel him.

850
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:32,756
Tag! You're it!

851
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,841
Wait! Boss! Ted!

852
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,061
Hey! Hey!

853
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,688
Teddy.

854
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,107
Listen to me.

855
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:36,111
Listen, I don't wanna leave here,
all right?

856
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,780
I mean, why would anybody want to?

857
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:42,325
We hear things here
about the outside world.

858
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:45,829
-About atolls, about H-bomb tests.
-Teddy, where are you?

859
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:47,914
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

860
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:51,251
-I know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen.
-That's funny.

861
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:54,254
-Boss!
-Other bombs explode, right?

862
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,673
But not the hydrogen bomb.

863
01:08:56,757 --> 01:09:02,220
It implodes, creating an explosion
to the thousandth, the millionth degree!

864
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,305
-Do you get it?
-Yeah! Yeah.

865
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,974
-Do you?
-I get it, I get it!

866
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,308
Let him go!

867
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,021
No!

868
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,283
No! No!

869
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,452
What are you doing?

870
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:29,455
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

871
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:31,040
You got Billings.

872
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:33,626
What the fuck's
the matter with you guys?

873
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,794
Catch them, not kill them!

874
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,839
-He jumped us.
-You, give me a hand with him.

875
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,341
We've gotta get him to the infirmary.
God damn it.

876
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,011
No, no! Not you, not you. Take a walk.

877
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:47,140
Come on. Cawley's gonna have
my goddamn balls for this.

878
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,298
Laeddis.

879
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:42,111
Laeddis.

880
01:10:53,165 --> 01:10:55,750
Stop me, please,

881
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:57,377
before I kill more.

882
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,881
Stop me before I kill more.

883
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:04,217
Laeddis.

884
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:14,227
Please, please.

885
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:20,441
I see you all.

886
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:24,570
Laeddis.

887
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:33,663
You told me I'd be free of this place.

888
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:36,666
You promised.

889
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,711
You lied.

890
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:41,587
Laeddis.

891
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,428
Laeddis?

892
01:11:49,887 --> 01:11:51,772
That's pretty damn funny.

893
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:56,436
-Your voice.
-Don't you recognize it?

894
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,856
After all the talks we had?

895
01:12:00,774 --> 01:12:02,817
After all the lies you told me?

896
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:04,694
Let me see your face.

897
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:07,155
They say I'm theirs now.

898
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,616
They say I'll never leave here.

899
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,037
Your match is about to go out.

900
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:19,375
-Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
-Why?

901
01:12:19,793 --> 01:12:21,252
So you can lie to me more?

902
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:24,339
-This isn't about the truth.
-Yes, it is.

903
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:28,009
-It's about exposing the truth.
-It's about you!

904
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,802
And Laeddis.

905
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,097
That's all it's ever been about.

906
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:37,894
I was incidental. A way in.

907
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:43,900
George... George Noyce.

908
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:48,529
No. It's not possible. You can't be here.

909
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:49,989
You like it?

910
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,618
Who did this to you, George?

911
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,952
You did.

912
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,913
What the hell do you mean?

913
01:12:56,997 --> 01:13:01,167
All your talk. All your fucking talk,
and I'm back in here because of you.

914
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:03,836
George, how did they get you
out of Dedham?

915
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,088
However this happened, I...

916
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,131
I'm gonna find a way to fix this,
you understand me?

917
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:11,094
I'll never get out now. I got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

918
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,054
Just tell me how they got you here.

919
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:15,848
They knew! Don't you get it?

920
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:19,310
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

921
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:23,773
This is a game. All of this is for you.

922
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:28,945
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

923
01:13:30,322 --> 01:13:31,531
Georgie...

924
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:35,284
-George, you're wrong. You're wrong.
-Really?

925
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:38,371
Been alone much since you got here?

926
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,707
I've been with my partner.

927
01:13:42,376 --> 01:13:44,127
You never worked with him before,
have you?

928
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,923
He's a U.S. Marshal. He's...

929
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:51,843
You never worked
with him before, have you?

930
01:13:54,638 --> 01:13:58,516
George, look, I know people.
I trust this man.

931
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,481
Then they've already won.

932
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,569
<i>Fuck.</i>

933
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:17,368
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

934
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,830
They're gonna cut into my brain.

935
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,916
And I'm only here

936
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:25,585
because of you!

937
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:29,005
George, I'm gonna get you out of here.

938
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:31,340
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

939
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:34,177
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

940
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:37,847
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

941
01:14:38,265 --> 01:14:41,267
-I'm not here to kill anyone.
-Liar!

942
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:44,437
I'm not gonna kill him, I swear to you!
I swear.

943
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:46,063
She's dead.

944
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,774
She... Let her go.

945
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,652
Let her go.

946
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,907
Tell him, Teddy.
Tell him why.

947
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,287
You gotta do it.
There's no other way.

948
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,414
-Let her go.
-Tell him about the day

949
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,375
-you brought me my locket.
-You gotta do it!

950
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:09,879
How I told you my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

951
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:12,840
She's fucking with your head.

952
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,800
And I told you it was from happiness.

953
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:17,345
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

954
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,643
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

955
01:15:25,812 --> 01:15:27,480
-I can't.
-You have to let her go!

956
01:15:27,564 --> 01:15:29,440
I can't! I can't.

957
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:38,866
Then you'll never leave this island.

958
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:45,831
Dolores.

959
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:54,465
He's not in this ward.

960
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:59,679
He was transferred out of here.

961
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:06,686
If he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place he can be.

962
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,110
The lighthouse.

963
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:22,535
Hey,

964
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:26,539
God help you.

965
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:36,632
Boss, we got problems.

966
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:39,302
McPherson and Cawley
are in the building.

967
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,137
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

968
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:44,098
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

969
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:46,058
Let's get the hell out of here. This way.

970
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:51,397
Just keep going. We belong here.

971
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:03,034
What happened to you?

972
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,744
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

973
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,662
where were you?

974
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,792
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

975
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,003
Did you ever find Laeddis?

976
01:17:14,087 --> 01:17:16,005
No. No, I never found him.

977
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:19,008
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

978
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:21,218
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

979
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:25,014
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

980
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:26,766
Here. Take a look.

981
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:28,934
I'll look at it later.

982
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:32,229
What's the matter, boss?

983
01:17:33,106 --> 01:17:35,608
I'll look it over later, that's all.

984
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:40,946
-Ashecliffe's that way.
-I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

985
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,408
I'm going to that lighthouse.

986
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,827
I'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

987
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,385
There it is.

988
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:07,223
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

989
01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:09,517
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

990
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:11,268
There could be a way
behind those trees.

991
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:14,438
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

992
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:15,564
-Boss...
-Come on.

993
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,025
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

994
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,902
It's proof there's a 67th patient,

995
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:22,822
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

996
01:18:23,281 --> 01:18:26,492
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

997
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,538
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

998
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:32,915
Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

999
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,834
Because climbing down there
when it's dark

1000
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:38,087
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

1001
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:41,590
Okay, maybe you better
sit this one out then.

1002
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:45,177
You brought me into this, boss,

1003
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:48,597
and now we're trapped here on this rock,
on this island,

1004
01:18:48,682 --> 01:18:50,224
with no one to rely on but each other,

1005
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:53,769
-and now you're acting like...
-Like what? Like what?

1006
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,896
How am I acting?

1007
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:03,654
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

1008
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:11,120
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

1009
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,372
I'm from Seattle.

1010
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:17,251
Seattle.

1011
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:21,714
I'm going on

1012
01:19:22,549 --> 01:19:23,758
alone.

1013
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:29,013
-I'm going with you, boss.
-I said alone.

1014
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:31,849
Fine.

1015
01:19:58,502 --> 01:19:59,752
Damn it!

1016
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,046
Damn it.

1017
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,137
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it.

1018
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,764
The tide was up.

1019
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:24,860
Chuck!

1020
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:27,673
Come on!

1021
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,209
Chuck!

1022
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,712
Where are you, Chuck?

1023
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:35,449
Chuck!

1024
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:21,328
Who are you?

1025
01:23:23,456 --> 01:23:26,291
I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.

1026
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:29,378
You're the marshal.

1027
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:32,006
That's right.

1028
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:38,053
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

1029
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:39,972
Why? Why?

1030
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:44,476
I wanna make sure that
what you're holding won't hurt me.

1031
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,861
I'm gonna keep this

1032
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,864
if you don't mind.

1033
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,116
Fine by me.

1034
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,501
You're...

1035
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,755
You're Rachel Solando.

1036
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:15,758
The real one.

1037
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:21,388
Did you kill your children?

1038
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,017
I never had children.

1039
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:27,478
I was never married.

1040
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:32,566
And before I was a patient at Ashecliffe,
I worked here.

1041
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:35,778
You... You were a nurse?

1042
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:40,074
I was a doctor, Marshal.

1043
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,204
You think I'm crazy.

1044
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,916
-No. No, no, I never...
-And if I say I'm not crazy?

1045
01:24:50,126 --> 01:24:52,544
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

1046
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:55,881
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1047
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,470
People tell the world you're crazy,

1048
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:05,474
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1049
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:09,228
I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1050
01:25:09,854 --> 01:25:11,814
Once you're declared insane,

1051
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:15,400
then anything you do is called
part of that insanity.

1052
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:18,003
Reasonable protests are denial.

1053
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:21,073
Valid fears, paranoia.

1054
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:22,741
Survival instincts are

1055
01:25:23,743 --> 01:25:25,202
defense mechanisms.

1056
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:29,248
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1057
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,793
-Tell me something.
-Yeah.

1058
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,754
What happened to you?

1059
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:40,008
I started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal

1060
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:41,844
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1061
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:43,637
Psychotropic drugs.

1062
01:25:45,014 --> 01:25:47,391
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1063
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:51,603
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1064
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:55,858
They zap the patient with electroshock,

1065
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,777
then go through the eye with an ice pick,

1066
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,031
pull out some nerve fibers.

1067
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:07,911
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1068
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,329
Tractable.

1069
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,291
It's barbaric,

1070
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:14,793
unconscionable.

1071
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:19,548
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1072
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,259
Depends on where you're hurt?

1073
01:26:22,343 --> 01:26:24,887
No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.

1074
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:27,306
The brain controls pain.

1075
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:32,519
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1076
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:36,648
What if you could control it?

1077
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:40,152
-You mean the brain?
-Recreate a man

1078
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:45,407
so he doesn't feel pain or love
or sympathy.

1079
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:48,410
A man who can't be interrogated,

1080
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:51,205
because he has no memories
to confess.

1081
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:57,461
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1082
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:01,673
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs

1083
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,425
during their brainwashing experiments.

1084
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:06,929
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1085
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:09,097
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world

1086
01:27:09,182 --> 01:27:12,434
and do things sane men...
Sane men never would.

1087
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:15,854
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1088
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:18,607
-that would take years.
-Years. Years of research.

1089
01:27:18,691 --> 01:27:21,401
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1090
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:26,615
50 years from now, people will
look back and say, here, this place,

1091
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,159
is where it all began.

1092
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:34,039
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags, and we,

1093
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:38,335
we tested patients on Shutter Island.

1094
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:41,672
No, they won't.

1095
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:43,632
No.

1096
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,220
You do understand

1097
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:53,058
that they can't let you leave.

1098
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,687
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1099
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:01,001
I was an esteemed psychiatrist

1100
01:28:01,664 --> 01:28:03,551
from a respected family.

1101
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,863
Didn't matter.

1102
01:28:09,575 --> 01:28:13,620
Let me ask you.
Any past traumas in your life?

1103
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:16,248
Yes.

1104
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,501
But why would that matter?

1105
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:21,878
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past

1106
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:24,464
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1107
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:29,928
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1108
01:28:30,013 --> 01:28:31,930
"Of course he cracked.

1109
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:34,182
"Who wouldn't
after what he'd been through?"

1110
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,768
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1111
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:39,813
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1112
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:46,862
-How's your head?
-My head?

1113
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:50,365
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1114
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:56,913
-Headaches?
-I am prone to migraines, yes.

1115
01:28:56,998 --> 01:28:58,290
Jesus.

1116
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:04,087
You haven't taken any pills, have you?
I mean, even aspirin?

1117
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,340
-The aspirin?
-Jesus.

1118
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:10,719
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1119
01:29:10,803 --> 01:29:14,181
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1120
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:19,269
No.

1121
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,730
No, I haven't.

1122
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:24,566
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics

1123
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:27,235
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1124
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:30,864
Palsy comes first,

1125
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:35,243
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1126
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:40,332
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal?

1127
01:29:42,835 --> 01:29:45,796
Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse.

1128
01:29:46,672 --> 01:29:48,006
Tell me.

1129
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:50,801
Brain surgery.

1130
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:55,931
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1131
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:59,351
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

1132
01:30:01,437 --> 01:30:03,897
That's where they create the ghosts.

1133
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:09,194
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1134
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,781
Everyone.

1135
01:30:12,865 --> 01:30:16,576
Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1136
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:20,455
-They couldn't possibly know...
-Everyone.

1137
01:30:39,392 --> 01:30:40,934
You can't stay here.

1138
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:42,853
They think I'm dead, that I drowned.

1139
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:45,939
I'm afraid if they come looking for you,
they might find me.

1140
01:30:46,023 --> 01:30:48,400
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1141
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:56,658
I'm gonna come back for you.

1142
01:30:56,742 --> 01:30:59,703
I won't be here. I move during the day.
New places every night.

1143
01:30:59,787 --> 01:31:02,122
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

1144
01:31:02,206 --> 01:31:04,124
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1145
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:08,253
The only way off the island is the ferry,
and they control it.

1146
01:31:09,213 --> 01:31:11,256
You'll never leave here.

1147
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,392
I had a friend.

1148
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:24,978
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1149
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:27,772
Have you seen him?

1150
01:31:28,941 --> 01:31:30,275
Marshal,

1151
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,945
you have no friends.

1152
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:07,812
There you are.

1153
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,318
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1154
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:16,488
Have a seat.

1155
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,240
Come on.

1156
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:31,545
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

1157
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:35,674
I was just looking around.

1158
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:41,054
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1159
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:44,015
-What?
-God's gift.

1160
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:47,519
The violence.

1161
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:54,734
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1162
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:58,655
it reached out for me like a divine hand.

1163
01:33:00,866 --> 01:33:02,701
God loves violence.

1164
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:08,206
-I hadn't noticed.
-Sure you have.

1165
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:11,543
Why else would there be so much of it?

1166
01:33:11,877 --> 01:33:13,253
It's in us.

1167
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:15,130
It's what we are.

1168
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:18,883
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1169
01:33:18,968 --> 01:33:21,511
and pillage and plunder
and tear at the flesh of our brothers.

1170
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:25,515
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1171
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,146
I thought God gave us moral order.

1172
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:34,232
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1173
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:38,403
There's no moral order at all.
There's just this,

1174
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,197
can my violence conquer yours?

1175
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:48,997
-I'm not violent.
-Yes, you are.

1176
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:52,542
You're as violent as they come.

1177
01:33:53,252 --> 01:33:56,838
I know this
because I'm as violent as they come.

1178
01:33:56,922 --> 01:33:59,090
If the constraints of society were lifted,

1179
01:33:59,175 --> 01:34:01,843
and I was all that stood
between you and a meal,

1180
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:05,305
you would crack my skull with a rock
and eat my meaty parts.

1181
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:08,850
Wouldn't you?

1182
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:14,064
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

1183
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,024
but I know different.

1184
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:18,401
-You don't know me.
-But I do.

1185
01:34:18,486 --> 01:34:21,112
-No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
-I know you.

1186
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:24,449
We've known each other for centuries.

1187
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:36,711
If I was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

1188
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:40,131
would you be able to stop me
before I blinded you?

1189
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:45,887
Give it a try.

1190
01:34:47,431 --> 01:34:49,140
That's the spirit.

1191
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:27,220
Don't worry, because we're going
to get you back to your room.

1192
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,806
-Not really.
-Something I've seen.

1193
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:31,141
Okay.

1194
01:35:36,355 --> 01:35:38,106
Where have you been?

1195
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:40,942
Just wandering.
Just looking at your island.

1196
01:35:41,026 --> 01:35:44,696
I forgot you're leaving
now that Rachel's been found.

1197
01:35:45,531 --> 01:35:46,948
-Stop looking at him.
-For sure. Yeah.

1198
01:35:47,032 --> 01:35:49,075
Stop looking at him. Stop looking at him.

1199
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:52,203
-Big meeting?
-Yes.

1200
01:35:52,288 --> 01:35:53,538
-It's okay. I'm...
-I don't like that.

1201
01:35:54,206 --> 01:35:56,207
Apparently there was
an unidentified man

1202
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:57,584
in Ward C yesterday.

1203
01:35:57,668 --> 01:36:01,045
He subdued a highly dangerous patient
quite handily.

1204
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:02,630
Is that so?

1205
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:05,175
It seems he had a long conversation
with a paranoid schizophrenic,

1206
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:06,468
George Noyce.

1207
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:09,345
Well, I don't remember
what I'm supposed to remember.

1208
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:11,139
We're gated down. We're fine.

1209
01:36:11,223 --> 01:36:15,268
This Noyce, you said his name was,
he's delusional?

1210
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:18,062
Extremely.
He can be quite upsetting.

1211
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:19,856
As a matter of fact, 2 weeks ago,

1212
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:24,402
a patient got so wound up by one
of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

1213
01:36:25,612 --> 01:36:26,871
Cigarette?

1214
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:30,658
No, thanks. I quit.

1215
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:35,789
-So you're taking the ferry?
-Yes, absolutely.

1216
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:38,583
I think we've gotten
all we came here for, so...

1217
01:36:39,418 --> 01:36:40,752
"We," Marshal?

1218
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:46,341
Speaking of which,
have you seen him, Doctor?

1219
01:36:46,425 --> 01:36:47,592
Who?

1220
01:36:48,427 --> 01:36:50,136
My partner, Chuck.

1221
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:55,308
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1222
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:59,938
You know, I've built
something valuable here,

1223
01:37:00,022 --> 01:37:03,191
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1224
01:37:03,275 --> 01:37:05,360
Everyone wants a quick fix.
They always have.

1225
01:37:05,444 --> 01:37:09,030
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1226
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:12,075
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1227
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,537
I can see that.

1228
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:22,252
So, tell me again about your partner.

1229
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:25,588
What partner?

1230
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:29,425
It's fine.

1231
01:38:17,766 --> 01:38:21,185
She made a mess.
I cleaned it up. She made a mess again.

1232
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:32,238
Marshal,

1233
01:38:33,616 --> 01:38:35,241
going somewhere?

1234
01:38:35,534 --> 01:38:36,803
I'm just...

1235
01:38:37,204 --> 01:38:38,953
heading out to the ferry, so...

1236
01:38:39,637 --> 01:38:42,081
Well, I'm afraid it's the other way.

1237
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:50,381
If you'll wait a moment, I'll find you
someone who can take you to the dock.

1238
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:58,890
-What's this, Doctor? What's this?
-It's just a sedative.

1239
01:38:58,974 --> 01:39:02,143
-A precaution.
-A precaution.

1240
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:07,941
What are you going to do? Kill me?

1241
01:39:08,275 --> 01:39:11,069
-Marshal.
-You think you deserve it?

1242
01:39:11,153 --> 01:39:13,947
For what? Provoking you?

1243
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:17,575
Well, forgive me.
What doesn't provoke you?

1244
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:21,079
-Remarks? Words?
-Nazis?

1245
01:39:21,705 --> 01:39:25,750
Well, that, too.
And, of course, memories, dreams.

1246
01:39:26,835 --> 01:39:31,089
Did you know that the word "trauma"
comes from the Greek for "wound"?

1247
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:34,509
And what is the German word
for "dream"?

1248
01:39:34,593 --> 01:39:36,761
Traum. Ein Traum.

1249
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:41,099
Wounds can create monsters,
and you...

1250
01:39:41,767 --> 01:39:44,143
You are wounded, Marshal.

1251
01:39:45,187 --> 01:39:48,356
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster,

1252
01:39:49,066 --> 01:39:50,817
you must stop it?

1253
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:52,610
Yeah.

1254
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:55,613
-I agree.
-Yes.

1255
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:57,532
Yeah.

1256
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:17,010
I told him that we'd take
about an hour to do it.

1257
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:20,179
Yeah. Did they say
we're going to do the 1st floor?

1258
01:40:20,264 --> 01:40:21,514
How long you been the clock?

1259
01:40:21,598 --> 01:40:23,975
I've been on for 18 hours straight.

1260
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:25,977
Nice paycheck.

1261
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,537
What are you doing, baby?

1262
01:40:49,334 --> 01:40:51,836
-You gotta get to the ferry.
-No.

1263
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:53,880
No, no.

1264
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,257
Yeah.

1265
01:40:57,384 --> 01:41:02,263
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he's perfect for their experiments.

1266
01:41:03,348 --> 01:41:05,600
There's only one place they'd take him.

1267
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:10,772
-You go there and you'll die.
-He's my partner.

1268
01:41:10,856 --> 01:41:12,940
If they are hurting him,
if they're holding him against his will,

1269
01:41:13,025 --> 01:41:14,734
I've gotta bring him out.

1270
01:41:14,943 --> 01:41:16,986
I can't lose anyone else.

1271
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:18,321
Don't go, Teddy, please.

1272
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:21,824
-Please, don't do this. Don't go.
-I'm sorry, honey.

1273
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:27,205
I'm sorry, honey.

1274
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:31,334
I love this thing
because you gave it to me,

1275
01:41:33,712 --> 01:41:35,546
but the truth is

1276
01:41:37,216 --> 01:41:39,383
it is one fucking ugly tie.

1277
01:42:19,591 --> 01:42:20,758
No.

1278
01:43:42,674 --> 01:43:44,050
Don't move. Stay where you are.

1279
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:47,470
Are you gonna kill me?

1280
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:51,682
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

1281
01:45:44,296 --> 01:45:46,172
Why are you all wet, baby?

1282
01:45:48,383 --> 01:45:51,635
-What did you say?
-You know exactly what I said.

1283
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:06,984
The rifle's empty, by the way.

1284
01:46:13,492 --> 01:46:14,992
Have a seat.

1285
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:23,918
For God's sake, dry off.
You'll catch cold.

1286
01:46:25,545 --> 01:46:26,670
All right.

1287
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:32,134
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1288
01:46:33,845 --> 01:46:36,847
I-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

1289
01:46:40,018 --> 01:46:41,936
Yes, he's here.

1290
01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:46,023
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look
at your man before you send him up.

1291
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:47,110
So...

1292
01:46:48,008 --> 01:46:51,220
Dr. Sheehan came in on the ferry
this morning?

1293
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,280
Not exactly.

1294
01:46:54,324 --> 01:46:57,368
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1295
01:46:58,286 --> 01:47:00,371
Sorry to hear about that.

1296
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:06,043
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1297
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:09,088
How are the hallucinations?

1298
01:47:09,172 --> 01:47:13,342
Get out of here, Teddy.
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1299
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:18,222
Not bad.

1300
01:47:18,306 --> 01:47:20,891
-They'll get worse.
-I know.

1301
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:26,063
Dr. Solando,
she told me about the neuroleptics.

1302
01:47:26,606 --> 01:47:29,066
Did she, now? And when was this?

1303
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:33,946
I found her, Doctor,
in a cave out by the cliffs.

1304
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:36,574
-But you'll never get to her.
-I don't doubt it,

1305
01:47:37,534 --> 01:47:39,201
considering she's not real.

1306
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:44,248
Your delusions are more severe
than I thought.

1307
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,626
You're not on neuroleptics.

1308
01:47:48,086 --> 01:47:49,962
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

1309
01:47:50,046 --> 01:47:52,673
Then what the fuck is this?
What the fuck is this?

1310
01:47:52,757 --> 01:47:53,757
Withdrawal.

1311
01:47:54,759 --> 01:47:56,719
Withdrawal? From what?

1312
01:47:56,803 --> 01:47:59,138
I haven't had a goddamn drink
since I've been on this island.

1313
01:47:59,222 --> 01:48:00,848
Chlorpromazine.

1314
01:48:01,683 --> 01:48:04,935
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say, in your case...

1315
01:48:05,437 --> 01:48:08,689
-Chloraproma-what?
-Chlorpromazine.

1316
01:48:08,773 --> 01:48:12,776
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

1317
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:16,197
So for the past 2 years, you...

1318
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:19,575
You've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston. Is that it?

1319
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:21,118
Not Boston.

1320
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:22,786
Here.

1321
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,541
You've been here for 2 years.
A patient of this institution.

1322
01:48:31,296 --> 01:48:33,464
After everything I've seen here, Doctor,

1323
01:48:35,133 --> 01:48:38,552
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy?

1324
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:40,596
Do you know the kind of people
that I deal with every day?

1325
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:42,556
I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

1326
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:44,517
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1327
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:48,395
Here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

1328
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,855
Proof of the 67th patient.

1329
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,106
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,

1330
01:48:51,191 --> 01:48:52,983
you could have blown the lid
off this place.

1331
01:48:53,068 --> 01:48:54,443
-Wait. Where did... Where did you...
-Yet somehow,

1332
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:57,446
you couldn't find time to look at it.
Well, read it now.

1333
01:48:58,323 --> 01:48:59,698
Go ahead.

1334
01:49:03,495 --> 01:49:07,331
"Patient is highly intelligent, highly
delusional decorated Army veteran.

1335
01:49:07,415 --> 01:49:10,000
"Present for the liberation of Dachau.

1336
01:49:11,253 --> 01:49:13,879
"Former U.S. Marshal.
Known proclivity for violence.

1337
01:49:13,964 --> 01:49:17,216
"Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies the crime ever...

1338
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:18,342
"Ever took place.

1339
01:49:18,426 --> 01:49:20,302
"Highly developed
and fantastical narratives,

1340
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:22,763
"which preclude
facing the truth of his actions."

1341
01:49:22,847 --> 01:49:25,516
I've had enough of this bullshit!
Where's my partner?

1342
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:27,184
Where's Chuck? Where is he?

1343
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:29,687
Let's try this another way.

1344
01:49:29,771 --> 01:49:32,314
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

1345
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:33,816
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you...

1346
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,776
I'm afraid I have to.

1347
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:39,989
Notice anything
these 4 names have in common?

1348
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:41,699
It's your rule of four.

1349
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:43,284
Andrew, what do you see?

1350
01:49:43,368 --> 01:49:46,370
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of...

1351
01:49:46,454 --> 01:49:48,872
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1352
01:49:49,874 --> 01:49:52,376
The names have the same letters.

1353
01:49:53,253 --> 01:49:56,672
Edward Daniels has exactly
the same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1354
01:49:56,756 --> 01:49:58,966
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1355
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:01,135
The names are anagrams
for each other.

1356
01:50:01,219 --> 01:50:03,804
Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

1357
01:50:03,888 --> 01:50:06,682
You came here for the truth. Here it is.

1358
01:50:06,766 --> 01:50:08,767
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1359
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:12,396
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1360
01:50:14,232 --> 01:50:15,190
Bullshit.

1361
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:17,484
You were committed here by court order
24 months ago.

1362
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:20,904
Your crime is terrible,
one you can't forgive yourself for,

1363
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:23,324
so you invented another self.

1364
01:50:25,535 --> 01:50:26,952
All right.

1365
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:30,122
Let's get down...
to the facts, all right?

1366
01:50:30,206 --> 01:50:33,083
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

1367
01:50:33,168 --> 01:50:37,212
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal, only
here at Ashecliffe because of a case,

1368
01:50:37,297 --> 01:50:38,797
and you've uncovered a conspiracy

1369
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:42,426
so that anything we tell you
about who you are, what you've done,

1370
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:44,553
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1371
01:50:44,638 --> 01:50:45,929
My name is Edward Daniels.

1372
01:50:46,014 --> 01:50:50,267
I've been hearing this fantasy
for 2 years now. I know every detail.

1373
01:50:50,352 --> 01:50:52,311
Patient 67, the storm,

1374
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:55,606
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1375
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:58,708
You were at Dachau,
but you may not have killed any guards.

1376
01:51:02,155 --> 01:51:05,824
I wish I could let you
just live in your fantasy world.

1377
01:51:05,909 --> 01:51:07,368
I really do.

1378
01:51:08,244 --> 01:51:10,454
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

1379
01:51:10,538 --> 01:51:12,831
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

1380
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:15,209
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1381
01:51:15,293 --> 01:51:17,211
2 weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1382
01:51:17,295 --> 01:51:19,546
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1383
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:21,507
-You had Noyce beaten.
-Of course I didn't!

1384
01:51:21,591 --> 01:51:23,676
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1385
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,136
Because he called you Laeddis,

1386
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:29,264
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1387
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:32,935
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1388
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:37,064
"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1389
01:51:38,983 --> 01:51:41,485
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1390
01:51:41,569 --> 01:51:43,445
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1391
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:46,907
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1392
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:49,118
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

1393
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:51,203
You almost killed him.

1394
01:51:52,872 --> 01:51:55,666
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1395
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:57,459
It's been decided

1396
01:51:57,544 --> 01:52:00,379
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now,

1397
01:52:00,672 --> 01:52:01,964
right now,

1398
01:52:02,257 --> 01:52:05,676
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1399
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:12,516
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

1400
01:52:16,771 --> 01:52:18,689
Yeah, I understand.

1401
01:52:19,524 --> 01:52:21,734
I understand just fine.

1402
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:26,447
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

1403
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:29,658
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1404
01:52:30,118 --> 01:52:31,493
But what about my partner?

1405
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:36,039
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1406
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:39,376
Hello, boss.

1407
01:52:57,407 --> 01:52:59,396
What the fuck is going on here?

1408
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:05,527
You working for him?

1409
01:53:06,362 --> 01:53:07,863
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1410
01:53:07,947 --> 01:53:10,866
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1411
01:53:13,745 --> 01:53:15,871
You been watching me?

1412
01:53:16,831 --> 01:53:18,916
Watching me every minute.

1413
01:53:19,834 --> 01:53:21,126
Who are you?

1414
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:22,961
Who are you? Tell me.

1415
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:25,631
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1416
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:30,761
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last 2 years.

1417
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:33,222
I'm Lester Sheehan.

1418
01:53:39,687 --> 01:53:42,356
-I told you, I told you about my wife, I...
-I know.

1419
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:45,692
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

1420
01:53:45,777 --> 01:53:49,404
I risked everything to come in here
after you. Everything!

1421
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:52,241
-I know, boss.
-We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1422
01:53:53,785 --> 01:53:55,369
I swore before the Board of Overseers

1423
01:53:55,453 --> 01:53:59,373
that I could construct the most radical,
cutting-edge role-play

1424
01:53:59,457 --> 01:54:01,708
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1425
01:54:01,793 --> 01:54:04,169
I thought that if we let you play this out

1426
01:54:04,921 --> 01:54:08,549
we could get you to see how untrue,
how impossible it is.

1427
01:54:09,634 --> 01:54:12,094
You've had the run of the place
for 2 days.

1428
01:54:12,178 --> 01:54:15,472
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1429
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:17,349
The satanic ORs?

1430
01:54:30,989 --> 01:54:34,533
Andrew, listen to me.

1431
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:36,827
If we fail with you,

1432
01:54:37,579 --> 01:54:41,498
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

1433
01:54:43,626 --> 01:54:46,795
We're on the front lines of a war
here, old boy.

1434
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:50,424
And right now, it all comes down to you.

1435
01:54:57,348 --> 01:55:00,058
-Don't move! Don't move!
-Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1436
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:03,353
My name is Edward Daniels!

1437
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:05,480
This one's loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1438
01:55:05,565 --> 01:55:08,150
I see. And that's your firearm, Marshal?
You're sure?

1439
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:09,443
My initials are on the side.

1440
01:55:09,527 --> 01:55:11,820
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1441
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:14,031
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1442
01:55:14,115 --> 01:55:15,157
Then blast away.

1443
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:18,577
Because that's the only way
you're ever getting off this island.

1444
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:26,543
Andrew, please don't.

1445
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:38,722
My gun.

1446
01:55:45,313 --> 01:55:47,898
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

1447
01:55:48,316 --> 01:55:50,484
It's a toy, Andrew.

1448
01:55:52,987 --> 01:55:55,072
We're telling you the truth.

1449
01:55:55,573 --> 01:55:58,825
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

1450
01:55:59,494 --> 01:56:02,579
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

1451
01:56:02,664 --> 01:56:03,789
You moved to that lake house

1452
01:56:03,873 --> 01:56:07,000
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

1453
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,377
-You were...
-You're lying!

1454
01:56:08,461 --> 01:56:11,922
-Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
-You drugged the cigarettes!

1455
01:56:12,006 --> 01:56:13,840
-All you've done is lie!
-Andrew. Andrew.

1456
01:56:13,925 --> 01:56:16,468
Your children. Andrew, your children.

1457
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:19,888
Simon. Henry.

1458
01:56:20,264 --> 01:56:21,556
I never had any children.

1459
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:25,686
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1460
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:28,981
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of

1461
01:56:29,691 --> 01:56:31,358
every night.

1462
01:56:31,442 --> 01:56:32,609
I never had a little girl.

1463
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:36,279
The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

1464
01:56:36,364 --> 01:56:38,281
saved them all.

1465
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:40,826
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

1466
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:43,787
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1467
01:56:44,539 --> 01:56:46,289
Andrew, are you?

1468
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:11,356
<i>I'm so sorry, baby.</i>

1469
01:57:15,737 --> 01:57:18,113
I told you not to come in here.

1470
01:57:18,573 --> 01:57:22,534
I told you this would be the end of you.

1471
01:57:42,889 --> 01:57:44,222
I'm back!

1472
01:57:44,849 --> 01:57:47,601
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

1473
01:57:47,685 --> 01:57:50,228
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

1474
01:57:50,313 --> 01:57:52,397
I could sleep for a week.

1475
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:57,561
Dolores?

1476
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,911
Dolores?

1477
01:58:10,708 --> 01:58:13,001
<i>And he said, "Take up
your bed and walk." But God?</i>

1478
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:14,127
Dolores?

1479
01:58:14,212 --> 01:58:15,504
<i>Then he said, "Take up
your bed and walk."</i>

1480
01:58:15,588 --> 01:58:17,589
<i>Forgive sins, but God?</i>

1481
01:58:28,559 --> 01:58:29,935
Dolores?

1482
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:56,503
Baby,

1483
01:58:58,548 --> 01:59:00,423
why are you all wet?

1484
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,302
I missed you.

1485
01:59:11,686 --> 01:59:13,353
I wanna go home.

1486
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:17,983
You are home.

1487
01:59:23,156 --> 01:59:24,990
Where are the kids?

1488
01:59:29,036 --> 01:59:30,787
They're in school.

1489
01:59:34,959 --> 01:59:36,960
It's Saturday, honey.

1490
01:59:38,129 --> 01:59:40,338
School's not in on Saturday.

1491
01:59:42,967 --> 01:59:44,593
My school is.

1492
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,482
My God.

1493
02:00:01,777 --> 02:00:03,236
My God!

1494
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:19,085
My God.

1495
02:00:23,257 --> 02:00:24,841
My God, no.

1496
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:29,930
Come on, come on.

1497
02:00:44,237 --> 02:00:47,364
No. No. Please, God.

1498
02:00:49,367 --> 02:00:50,867
Please, God, no!

1499
02:00:51,077 --> 02:00:54,120
No!

1500
02:00:56,374 --> 02:00:57,884
No.

1501
02:01:02,804 --> 02:01:04,104
No.

1502
02:01:06,504 --> 02:01:07,884
No.

1503
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:53,471
Baby.

1504
02:02:12,283 --> 02:02:14,784
Let's put them at the table, Andrew.

1505
02:02:15,619 --> 02:02:18,830
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

1506
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,218
They'll be our living dolls.

1507
02:02:27,465 --> 02:02:30,216
Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.

1508
02:02:35,222 --> 02:02:37,182
If you ever loved me, Dolores,

1509
02:02:38,559 --> 02:02:40,101
please stop talking.

1510
02:02:46,317 --> 02:02:47,817
I love you.

1511
02:02:56,535 --> 02:02:58,119
Set me free.

1512
02:03:03,192 --> 02:03:04,209
Baby.

1513
02:03:07,671 --> 02:03:09,589
We'll give them baths.

1514
02:03:12,843 --> 02:03:16,054
-I love you, baby.
-I love you, too.

1515
02:03:16,138 --> 02:03:17,931
-I love you so much.
-I love you so much.

1516
02:03:18,015 --> 02:03:19,015
I love you. I...

1517
02:03:43,857 --> 02:03:45,542
Baby.

1518
02:03:51,340 --> 02:03:52,674
Andrew.

1519
02:03:54,718 --> 02:03:56,719
Andrew, can you hear me?

1520
02:03:57,012 --> 02:04:00,890
Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

1521
02:04:03,144 --> 02:04:04,436
Rachel?

1522
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:08,398
Rachel who?

1523
02:04:11,277 --> 02:04:13,361
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

1524
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:16,281
My daughter.

1525
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:21,619
Why are you here?

1526
02:04:24,832 --> 02:04:26,374
Because I killed my wife.

1527
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:28,585
And why did you do that?

1528
02:04:32,089 --> 02:04:35,258
Because she murdered our children,

1529
02:04:38,179 --> 02:04:39,721
and she told me to let her go.

1530
02:04:43,767 --> 02:04:46,936
-Who's Teddy Daniels?
-He doesn't exist.

1531
02:04:49,273 --> 02:04:51,733
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1532
02:04:51,817 --> 02:04:55,778
-Why?
-We need to hear you say it.

1533
02:05:02,369 --> 02:05:05,580
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

1534
02:05:07,625 --> 02:05:09,584
Dolores told me she...

1535
02:05:10,544 --> 02:05:14,797
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

1536
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:21,513
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1537
02:05:21,597 --> 02:05:25,808
just pulling the wires just for fun.

1538
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:31,272
She told me that.

1539
02:05:32,733 --> 02:05:35,568
She told me that, but I didn't listen.

1540
02:05:39,281 --> 02:05:41,574
I loved her so much, you know.

1541
02:05:42,993 --> 02:05:44,619
Why did you make them up?

1542
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:51,167
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1543
02:05:55,005 --> 02:05:56,339
And I...

1544
02:05:58,842 --> 02:06:03,346
I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help,
you know.

1545
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:09,185
I killed them.

1546
02:06:13,983 --> 02:06:15,108
Here's my fear, Andrew.

1547
02:06:15,192 --> 02:06:18,403
We broke through once before,
9 months ago,

1548
02:06:18,487 --> 02:06:19,487
and then you regressed.

1549
02:06:22,032 --> 02:06:25,368
-I don't remember that.
-I know.

1550
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:28,663
You reset, Andrew.

1551
02:06:29,123 --> 02:06:33,209
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1552
02:06:34,461 --> 02:06:35,920
I hope that what we've done here
will be enough

1553
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:38,932
to stop it from ever
happening again, but

1554
02:06:39,216 --> 02:06:42,719
I need to know
you've accepted reality.

1555
02:06:49,226 --> 02:06:51,978
You came after me, Doctor?

1556
02:06:53,856 --> 02:06:57,734
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

1557
02:07:09,538 --> 02:07:12,415
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1558
02:07:19,423 --> 02:07:22,884
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1559
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:32,300
Subtitles: Arigon

1560
02:07:47,618 --> 02:07:49,619
How we doing this morning?

1561
02:07:50,204 --> 02:07:53,456
-Good. And you?
-Can't complain.

1562
02:08:03,759 --> 02:08:05,343
So what's our next move?

1563
02:08:06,637 --> 02:08:08,096
You tell me.

1564
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:15,144
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.

1565
02:08:16,313 --> 02:08:17,605
Get back to the mainland.

1566
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:20,650
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

1567
02:08:42,589 --> 02:08:45,591
Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1568
02:08:51,348 --> 02:08:54,183
That's right. We're too smart for them.

1569
02:08:55,310 --> 02:08:57,437
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1570
02:09:13,078 --> 02:09:15,830
You know,
this place makes me wonder...

1571
02:09:16,373 --> 02:09:18,458
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1572
02:09:19,418 --> 02:09:21,377
Which would be worse,

1573
02:09:22,212 --> 02:09:23,880
to live as a monster

1574
02:09:24,798 --> 02:09:26,466
or to die as a good man?

1575
02:09:36,185 --> 02:09:37,477
Teddy?
