00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:10,594
A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release

1
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,593
- Is everything in place?
- You aren't supposed to relieve me.

2
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,471
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.

3
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,390
You like him, don't you?
You like watching him.

4
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:01,643
- Don't be ridiculous.
- We're gonna kill him. You understand that?

5
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,354
Morpheus believes he is the One.

6
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,564
Do you?

7
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,566
It doesn't matter what I believe.

8
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,443
You know, do you?

9
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,779
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

10
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,614
Are you sure this line is clean?

11
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,866
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

12
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,659
I better go.

13
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,407
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

14
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,034
Do it! Do it now!

15
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,058
- Lieutenant.
- Oh, shit.

16
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,104
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

17
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,064
I'm just doing my job.

18
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:34,111
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

19
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,072
The orders were for your protection.

20
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,784
I think we can handle one little girl.

21
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,666
I sent two units!

22
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,501
They're bringing her down now!

23
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,880
No, lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

24
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,035
Shit.

25
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,040
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

26
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,917
I know. They cut the hard line.

27
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,294
There's no time.
Get to another exit.

28
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,963
- Are there any agents?
- Yes.

29
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,340
Goddamn it.

30
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,133
You have to focus, Trinity.

31
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,761
There's a phone at Wells and Lake.

32
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,804
You can make it.

33
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,723
- All right.
- Go.

34
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,911
That's impossible.

35
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,906
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.

36
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,783
Get up.

37
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,164
She got out.

38
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,749
It doesn't matter.

39
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,169
- The informant is real.
- Yes.

40
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,088
We have the name of their next target.

41
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,006
The name is Neo.

42
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,803
We'll need a search running.

43
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,013
It has already begun.

44
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,986
What?

45
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,243
What the hell?

46
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,836
"Follow the white rabbit."

47
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:55,849
Who is it?

48
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,392
It's Choi.

49
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,357
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,073
You're two hours late.

51
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,409
I know. It's her fault.

52
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,660
You got the money?

53
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,955
Two grand.

54
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,957
Hold on.

55
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,018
Hallelujah.

56
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,146
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

57
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,273
You get caught using that ... .

58
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,651
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

59
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,862
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

60
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,156
You look a little whiter than usual.

61
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,451
My computer, it ... .

62
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:04,000
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?

63
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,546
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

64
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,173
It's the only way to fly.

65
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,552
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.

66
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,304
Get some R and R?

67
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,475
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

68
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,687
Definitely.

69
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:27,023
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

70
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,775
Come on.

71
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,653
It'll be fun. I promise.

72
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,661
Yeah.

73
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,330
Sure. I'll go.

74
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,026
Hello, Neo.

75
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,528
How do you know that name?

76
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,072
I know a lot about you.

77
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,034
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

78
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,202
Trinity.

79
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,997
The Trinity?

80
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,166
That cracked the lRS D-base?

81
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,876
That was a long time ago.

82
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,045
- Jesus.
- What?

83
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,297
I just thought ... 

84
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,216
 ... you were a guy.

85
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,926
Most guys do.

86
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,347
That was you on my computer.

87
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,057
How did you do that?

88
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,435
Right now, all I can tell you ... 

89
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,604
 ... is that you're in danger.

90
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,482
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

91
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,734
They're watching you, Neo.

92
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,737
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

93
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,076
I know why you're here, Neo.

94
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,828
I know what you've been doing.

95
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,955
I know why you hardly sleep ... 

96
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,376
 ... why you live alone and why,
night after night ... 

97
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,961
 ... you sit at your computer.

98
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,673
You're looking for him.

99
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,468
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

100
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,096
And when he found me ... 

101
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,808
 ... he told me I wasn't really
looking for him ... 

102
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,477
 ... I was looking for an answer.

103
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,231
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

104
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,567
It's the question
that brought you here.

105
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,029
You know the question ... 

106
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,781
 ... just as I did.

107
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,951
What is the Matrix?

108
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,662
The answer is out there, Neo.

109
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,331
It's looking for you.

110
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,792
And it will find you ... 

111
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,086
 ... if you want it to.

112
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,844
Shit.

113
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,220
Shit, shit.

114
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,316
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

115
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:19,612
You believe that you are special,
that somehow the rules do not apply to you.

116
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,323
Obviously, you are mistaken.

117
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,163
This company is one of the top
software companies in the world ... 

118
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,791
 ... because every single employee understands
that they are part of a whole.

119
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:36,671
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

120
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,135
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

121
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,890
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth ... 

122
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,101
 ... or you choose to find yourself another job.

123
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,312
Do I make myself clear?

124
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,981
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

125
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,324
Thomas Anderson?

126
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,994
Yeah, that's me.

127
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,996
Okay.

128
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,170
Great.

129
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,756
Have a nice day.

130
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,272
Hello?

131
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,901
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?

132
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,905
- Morpheus.
- Yes.

133
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,157
I've been looking for you.

134
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,577
I don't know if you're ready to see
what I want to show you.

135
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,997
But unfortunately, you and l
have run out of time.

136
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,960
They're coming for you Neo, and I don't know
what they're going to do.

137
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,545
Who's coming for me?

138
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,880
Stand up and see for yourself.

139
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,632
What? Right now?

140
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,426
Yes. Now.

141
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,179
Do it slowly.

142
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,806
The elevator.

143
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,479
- Oh, shit!
- Yes.

144
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,235
What the hell do they want from me?

145
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,738
I don't know but if you don't want
to find out, get out of there.

146
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,948
How?

147
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:30,326
I can guide you,
but you must do exactly as I say.

148
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,204
- Okay.
- The cubicle across from you is empty.

149
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,459
- But what if they--
- Go. Now.

150
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,594
Stay here for just a moment.

151
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,562
When I tell you,
go to the end of the row ... 

152
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,772
 ... to the office
at the end of the hall.

153
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,400
Stay as low as you can.

154
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:05,820
Go. Now.

155
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,755
Good. Now, outside
there is a scaffold.

156
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,801
- How do you know this?
- We don't have time.

157
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,888
To your left there's a window.
Go to it.

158
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,683
Open it.

159
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,311
Take the scaffold to the roof.

160
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,147
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

161
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,775
There are two ways
out of this building.

162
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,820
One is that scaffold.
The other is in their custody.

163
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,282
You take a chance either way.
I leave it to you.

164
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,621
This is insane!

165
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,666
Why is this happening to me?

166
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,584
What'd I do?

167
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,712
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

168
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,756
I'm gonna die.

169
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,600
Shit!

170
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,997
Oh, shit!

171
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,753
I can't do this.

172
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,434
Shit.

173
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:53,529
As you can see, we've had our eye on
you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

174
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,492
It seems that you've been living ... 

175
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,869
 ... two lives.

176
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,790
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson ... 

177
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,376
 ... program writer for
a respectable software company.

178
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,714
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

179
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,424
And you ... 

180
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,638
 ... help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

181
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,268
The other life is lived in computers ... 

182
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,522
 ... where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo" ... 

183
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,568
 ... and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

184
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,822
One of these lives ... 

185
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,907
 ... has a future.

186
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,243
And one of them does not.

187
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,792
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

188
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,128
You're here ... 

189
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,713
 ... because we need your help.

190
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,345
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain ... 

191
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,389
 ... individual.

192
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:06,352
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

193
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:11,357
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

194
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,026
He is considered by many authorities ... 

195
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,321
 ... to be the most dangerous man alive.

196
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,242
My colleagues ... 

197
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,620
 ... believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

198
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,332
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

199
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,128
We're willing to wipe the slate clean ... 

200
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,630
 ... give you a fresh start.

201
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,050
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation ... 

202
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,804
 ... in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

203
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,432
Yeah.

204
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,810
That sounds like a really good deal.

205
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,189
But I think I got a better one.

206
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,940
How about ... 

207
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,359
 ... I give you the finger ... 

208
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,947
 ... and you give me my phone call.

209
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,993
Mr. Anderson ... 

210
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,207
 ... you disappoint me.

211
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,084
You can't scare me
with this Gestapo crap.

212
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,711
I know my rights.

213
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,463
I want my phone call.

214
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,216
Tell me, Mr. Anderson ... 

215
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,509
 ... what good is a phone call ... 

216
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,347
 ... if you're unable to speak?

217
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,341
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson ... 

218
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,010
 ... whether you want to or not.

219
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,697
This line is tapped,
so I must be brief.

220
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:09,243
They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you are.

221
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,329
If they knew what I know ... 

222
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,581
 ... you would probably be dead.

223
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,294
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

224
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:23,382
You are the One, Neo. You see you may
have spent the last few years ... 

225
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,594
 ... looking for me, but I've spent
my entire life ... 

226
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,346
 ... looking for you.

227
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,058
Now, do you still want to meet?

228
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,895
- Yes.
- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.

229
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,323
Get in.

230
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,419
What the hell is this?

231
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,214
It's necessary, Neo.
For our protection.

232
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,633
- From what?
- From you.

233
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,636
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

234
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:09,970
Stop the car.

235
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,726
Listen to me, coppertop.

236
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,978
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

237
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,856
Right now, there's only one rule:

238
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,483
Our way ... 

239
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,901
 ... or the highway.

240
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,534
Fine.

241
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,871
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

242
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,083
- Why?
- Because you have been down there Neo.

243
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,043
You know that road.

244
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,671
You know exactly where it ends.

245
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,134
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

246
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,858
Apoc, lights.

247
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,529
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

248
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,700
- What's that?
- I think you're bugged.

249
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,917
Try and relax.

250
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,469
Come on.

251
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,221
It's on the move.

252
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,224
Come on, you shit.

253
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,312
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

254
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,563
Clear!

255
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,282
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real!?

256
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,359
This is it.

257
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,156
Let me give you one piece of advice.

258
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,784
Be honest.

259
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,579
He knows more than you can imagine.

260
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,631
At last.

261
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,259
Welcome, Neo.

262
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,387
As you no doubt have guessed ... 

263
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,888
 ... I am Morpheus.

264
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,516
It's an honor to meet you.

265
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,017
No ... 

266
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,894
 ... the honor is mine.

267
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,314
Please, come. Sit.

268
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,039
I imagine ... 

269
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,209
 ... that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice ... 

270
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,338
 ... tumbling down the rabbit hole?

271
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,257
You could say that.

272
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,802
I can see it in your eyes.

273
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,681
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees ... 

274
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,183
 ... because he's expecting to wake up.

275
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,187
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

276
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,274
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

277
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,525
No.

278
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:52,985
Why not?

279
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,030
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

280
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,451
I know exactly what you mean.

281
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,124
Let me tell you why you're here.

282
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,710
You are here because you know something.

283
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,879
What you know,
you can't explain.

284
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,964
But you feel it.

285
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,467
You felt it your entire life:

286
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:21,221
That there is something wrong with the world.
You don't know what it is, but it's there.

287
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,932
Like a splinter in your mind ... 

288
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,060
 ... driving you mad.

289
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,730
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

290
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,109
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

291
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,279
The Matrix?

292
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,450
Do you want to know ... 

293
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,911
 ... what it is?

294
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,165
The Matrix is everywhere.

295
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,125
It is all around us.

296
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,336
Even now, in this very room.

297
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,381
You can see it when you
look out your window ... 

298
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,966
 ... or when you turn on your television.

299
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,928
You can feel it when you go to work ... 

300
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,139
 ... when you go to church ... 

301
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:06,642
 ... when you pay your taxes.

302
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,688
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes ... 

303
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,523
 ... to blind you from the truth.

304
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:15,984
What truth?

305
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,782
That you are a slave.

306
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,577
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage ... 

307
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:30,499
 ... born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

308
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,084
A prison ... 

309
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,460
 ... for your mind.

310
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,803
Unfortunately, no one can be ... 

311
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,514
 ... told what the Matrix is.

312
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,853
You have to see it for yourself.

313
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,656
This is your last chance.

314
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,242
After this, there is no turning back.

315
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,161
You take the blue pill ... 

316
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,539
 ... the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe ... 

317
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,583
 ... whatever you want to believe.

318
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,168
You take the red pill ... 

319
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,378
 ... you stay in Wonderland ... 

320
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,590
 ... and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

321
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,684
Remember ... 

322
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,563
 ... all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

323
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,204
Follow me.

324
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,416
Apoc, are we on-line?

325
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,043
Almost.

326
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,423
Time is always against us.

327
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,300
Please take a seat there.

328
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,195
- You did all this?
- Mm-hm.

329
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,326
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

330
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:34,706
Is designed to disrupt your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

331
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,291
What does that mean?

332
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,044
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy ... 

333
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,712
 ... because Kansas ... 

334
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,005
 ... is going bye-bye.

335
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,295
Did you ... ?

336
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:36,393
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

337
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,439
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

338
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,191
How would you know the difference
between the dream world ... 

339
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,235
 ... and the real world?

340
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,030
This can't be.

341
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,239
Be what?

342
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,450
Be real?

343
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,830
- Going into replication.
- Apoc?

344
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Still nothing.

345
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,833
It's cold.

346
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,460
It's cold!

347
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,007
Tank, we're gonna need a signal soon.

348
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,178
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

349
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,888
Targeting almost there.

350
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,601
He's going into arrest.

351
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,354
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

352
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,698
Welcome ... 

353
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,951
 ... to the real world.

354
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,204
We've done it, Trinity.

355
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,997
We found him.

356
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,042
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

357
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,211
I know it.

358
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,425
Am I dead?

359
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,095
Far from it.

360
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,485
He still needs a lot of work.

361
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,113
What are you doing?

362
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,574
Your muscles have atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

363
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,701
Why do my eyes hurt?

364
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,287
You've never used them before.

365
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,083
Rest, Neo.

366
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,002
The answers are coming.

367
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,161
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

368
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,871
What is this place?

369
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,791
More important than "what" is "when."

370
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,334
"When"?

371
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,586
You believe it's the year 1999 ... 

372
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,089
 ... when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

373
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,968
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is ... 

374
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,844
 ... because we honestly don't know.

375
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,181
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

376
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,184
Come with me.
See for yourself.

377
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,478
This is my ship.

378
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,690
The Nebuchadnezzar.
It's a hovercraft.

379
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,278
This is the main deck.

380
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,285
This is the core ... 

381
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:14,541
 ... where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

382
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,089
Most of my crew you already know.

383
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,512
This is Apoc ... 

384
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,639
 ... Switch ... 

385
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,392
 ... and Cypher.
- Hi.

386
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,354
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

387
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,649
The little one behind you is Mouse.

388
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:47,240
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

389
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,492
Trinity.

390
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,098
Try to relax.

391
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,813
This will feel a little weird.

392
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,160
This ... 

393
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,037
 ... is the Construct.

394
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,581
It's our loading program.

395
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,292
We can load anything, from clothing ... 

396
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,919
 ... to equipment ... 

397
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,545
 ... weapons ... 

398
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:45,006
 ... training simulations ... 

399
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,926
 ... anything we need.

400
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,139
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

401
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,350
Is it really so hard to believe?

402
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,478
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your arms and head are gone.

403
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,773
Your hair has changed.

404
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,485
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

405
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,822
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

406
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,829
This isn't real?

407
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,622
What is "real"?

408
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,250
How do you define "real"?

409
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,460
If you're talking about
what you can feel ... 

410
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,130
 ... what you can smell, taste and see ... 

411
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,259
 ... then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

412
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,849
This is the world that you know.

413
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,311
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

414
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,026
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation ... 

415
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,528
 ... that we call the Matrix.

416
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,869
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

417
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,996
This is the world ... 

418
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,039
 ... as it exists today.

419
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:16,055
Welcome to "the desert ... 

420
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,516
 ... of the real."

421
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,272
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

422
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:28,318
But what we know for certain is that 
at some point in the early 21st century ... 

423
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,821
 ... all of mankind was united
in celebration.

424
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:36,826
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to AI.

425
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,745
Al.

426
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,164
You mean artificial intelligence.

427
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:45,835
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

428
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,131
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

429
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,760
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

430
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:57,597
At that time they were dependent on solar power ... 

431
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,184
 ... and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive ... 

432
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,021
 ... without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

433
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:10,151
Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive.

434
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:15,823
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

435
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:23,456
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-voIt battery.

436
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:27,835
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

437
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,923
Combined with a form of fusion ... 

438
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:37,095
 ... the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

439
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:44,894
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields ... 

440
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:48,398
 ... where human beings
are no longer born.

441
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,942
We are grown.

442
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,576
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

443
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,495
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes ... 

444
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,456
 ... watched them liquefy the dead ... 

445
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,043
 ... so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

446
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,840
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision ... 

447
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,010
 ... I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

448
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:21,431
What is the Matrix?

449
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,683
Control.

450
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,438
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world ... 

451
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:32,317
 ... built to keep us under control ... 

452
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,654
 ... in order to change a human being ... 

453
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,448
 ... into this.

454
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,950
No.

455
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,162
I don't believe it.

456
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,747
It's not possible.

457
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,918
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

458
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,462
Stop!

459
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,213
Let me out!

460
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,841
Let me out! I want out!

461
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,471
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

462
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,389
Get this thing out of me!

463
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,684
Don't touch me!

464
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,561
Stay away from me!

465
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:14,150
I don't believe it.

466
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,444
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo.

467
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,904
Just breathe.

468
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,091
I can't go back, can I?

469
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,343
No.

470
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,387
But if you could ... 

471
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,722
 ... would you really want to?

472
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,601
I feel I owe you an apology.

473
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,561
We have a rule.

474
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,273
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

475
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:55,525
It's dangerous.

476
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,944
The mind has trouble letting go.

477
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,488
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

478
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,616
I did what I did because ... 

479
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,785
 ... I had to.

480
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:18,297
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside ... 

481
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,593
 ... who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted ... 

482
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,888
 ... to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

483
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:31,102
It was he who freed the first of us ... 

484
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,604
 ... taught us the truth.

485
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,151
As long as the Matrix exists ... 

486
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,570
 ... the human race will never be free.

487
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,325
After he died ... 

488
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,787
 ... the Oracle prophesied his return ... 

489
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,541
 ... and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix ... 

490
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,460
 ... end the war ... 

491
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,044
 ... bring freedom to our people.

492
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,009
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix ... 

493
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,927
 ... looking for him.

494
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,432
I did what I did because ... 

495
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,186
 ... I believe that search is over.

496
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,692
Get some rest.

497
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,111
You're going to need it.

498
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,865
For what?

499
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:30,119
Your training.

500
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,139
Morning. Did you sleep?

501
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,225
You will tonight.

502
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,143
I guarantee it.

503
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,563
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

504
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,441
- You don't have any --
- Holes? Nope.

505
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,072
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%
pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

506
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,532
Born free right here ... 

507
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,408
 ... in the real world.

508
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,327
Genuine child of Zion.

509
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,622
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow ... 

510
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,374
 ... Zion's where the party would be.

511
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,084
It's a city?

512
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,504
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

513
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,340
Where is it?

514
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,512
Deep underground near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

515
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,015
You live long enough,
you might see it.

516
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:40,106
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I feel excited
to see what you're capable of ... 

517
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,108
 ... if Morpheus is right and all.

518
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:45,361
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but ... 

519
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,029
 ... if you are ... 

520
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,116
 ... it's a very exciting time.

521
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,870
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

522
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,710
We're supposed to start
with these operations programs first.

523
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,172
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

524
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,966
How about ... 

525
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,303
 ... combat training?

526
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,810
"Jujitsu"?

527
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,354
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

528
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,909
Holy shit!

529
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,494
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

530
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,121
How about some more?

531
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,664
Hell, yes.

532
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,792
Hell, yeah.

533
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,056
How is he?

534
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,475
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

535
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,071
I know kung fu.

536
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,740
Show me.

537
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,285
This is a sparring program ... 

538
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,330
 ... similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

539
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,916
It has the same basic rules.
Rules like gravity.

540
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,628
What you must learn is that these rules are no 
different than the rules in a computer system.

541
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,672
Some of them can be bent.

542
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,341
Others can be broken.

543
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:31,968
Understand?

544
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,095
Then hit me ... 

545
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,805
 ... if you can.

546
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:15,845
Good!

547
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,763
Adaptation.

548
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,265
Improvisation.

549
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,891
But your weakness ... 

550
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,518
 ... is not your technique.

551
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,569
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

552
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,017
How did I beat you?

553
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,691
You're too fast.

554
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,568
Do you believe that ... 

555
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,446
 ... my being stronger or faster ... 

556
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:01,367
 ... has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

557
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,206
You think that's air you're breathing?

558
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,929
Again!

559
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,818
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

560
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,279
Take a look at his neuro-kinetics,
they are way above normal.

561
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,202
What are you waiting for?

562
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,413
You're faster than this.

563
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,834
Don't think you are.

564
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,752
Know you are.

565
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,932
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

566
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,611
I don't believe it.

567
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,281
I know what you're trying to do.

568
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,118
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

569
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,537
But I can only show you the door.

570
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,956
You are the one who has to walk through it.

571
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,461
Tank, load the jump program.

572
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,767
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear ... 

573
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,478
 ... doubt and disbelief.

574
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,357
Free your mind.

575
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,741
Whoa.

576
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,250
Okey-dokey.

577
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,503
Free my mind.

578
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,088
What if he makes it?

579
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,049
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

580
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,844
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

581
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,513
Come on.

582
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,931
All right.

583
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,433
No problem. Free my mind.

584
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,020
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

585
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,083
What does that mean?

586
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,294
It does not mean anything.

587
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:01,463
Everybody falls the first time.

588
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,215
Right, Trin?

589
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,530
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

590
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,036
If you're killed in the Matrix ... 

591
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,245
 ... you die here?

592
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,332
The body cannot live without the mind.

593
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:10,199
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

594
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,121
There is something about him,
isn't there?

595
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:18,374
Don't tell me you're a believer now?

596
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,584
I just keep wondering ... 

597
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:24,505
 ... if Morpheus is so sure,
why doesn't he take him to see the Oracle?

598
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,342
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

599
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,686
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

600
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,731
That system is our enemy.

601
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,692
But when you're inside, you look around.
What do you see?

602
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:49,738
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

603
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,783
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

604
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,994
But until we do, these people are still
a part of that system ... 

605
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:58,163
 ... and that makes them our enemy.

606
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,540
You have to understand ... 

607
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,127
 ... most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

608
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,962
And many of them are so inert ... 

609
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,631
 ... so hopelessly dependent
on the system ... 

610
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,592
 ... that they will fight to protect it.

611
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,848
Were you listening to me Neo or were you
looking at the woman in the red dress?

612
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,766
- I was --
- Look again.

613
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,102
Freeze it.

614
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,360
- This isn't the Matrix?
- No.

615
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,991
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

616
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,035
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

617
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,372
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

618
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,419
They can move in and out of any
software still hardwired to their system.

619
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:49,173
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged ... 

620
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:50,841
 ... is potentially an agent.

621
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,635
Inside the Matrix ... 

622
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,929
 ... they are everyone ... 

623
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,973
 ... and they are no one.

624
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,351
We have survived by hiding from them
By running from them ... 

625
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,228
 ... but they are the gatekeepers.

626
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,440
They're guarding all the doors.
They are holding all the keys which means that

627
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,526
Sooner or later, someone is going to
have to fight them.

628
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:10,903
Someone?

629
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,654
I won't lie to you, Neo.

630
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:17,951
Every single man or woman who has stood their ground
Everyone who has fought an agent, has died.

631
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,579
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

632
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,830
Why?

633
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,374
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

634
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:28,212
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

635
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:33,091
Yet their strength and their speed are still
based in a world that is built on rules.

636
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,468
Because of that ... 

637
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,096
 ... they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

638
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,269
What are you trying to tell me?

639
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,438
That I can dodge bullets?

640
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,816
No, Neo.

641
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,237
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready ... 

642
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,447
 ... you won't have to.

643
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,786
We've got trouble.

644
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,182
- Did Zion send a warning?
- No, another ship.

645
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,728
Shit.

646
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,856
- Squiddies. We've been in crick.
- Squiddy?

647
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,277
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

648
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,736
Search and destroy.

649
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,239
Set her down right over there.

650
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,012
How are we doing, Tank?

651
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,896
Power off-line.

652
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,357
EMP armed ... 

653
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,443
 ... and ready.
- EMP?

654
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,612
Electromagnetic pulse.

655
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,740
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

656
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,200
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

657
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,126
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

658
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,503
Sewers.

659
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,423
They used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

660
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,842
Now these sewers are
all that's left of them.

661
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,427
Quiet.

662
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,469
Whoa! Neo.

663
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,473
You scared the bejesus out of me.

664
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,476
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

665
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,230
Is that ... ?

666
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,065
The Matrix?

667
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,441
Yeah.

668
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:41,405
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

669
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:44,741
The image translators work
for the construct program.

670
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:48,412
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

671
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:51,623
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

672
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:55,293
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

673
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,838
Hey, you eh ... 

674
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,214
 ... want a drink?

675
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:00,507
Sure.

676
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,512
You know ... 

677
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,973
 ... I know what you're thinking.

678
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,308
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

679
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:13,979
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

680
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,900
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

681
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:33,206
Good shit, huh?

682
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,750
Dozer makes it.

683
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:36,376
It's good for two things:

684
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,713
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

685
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,924
So, can I ask you something?

686
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,554
Did he tell you why he did it?

687
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,017
Why you're here?

688
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,439
Jesus!

689
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,567
What a mind job.

690
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,780
So you're here to save the world.

691
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,366
What do you say
to something like that?

692
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:14,915
A little piece of advice.

693
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,126
You see an agent ... 

694
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,754
 ... you do what we do:

695
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,631
Run.

696
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,716
You run your ass off.

697
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,683
Thanks for the drink.

698
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:39,564
Sweet dreams.

699
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,988
- Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

700
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,782
You know ... 

701
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,661
 ... I know this steak doesn't exist.

702
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,414
I know that when I put it
in my mouth ... 

703
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,751
 ... the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is ... 

704
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,169

 ... juicy ... 

705
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,171
 ... and delicious.

706
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,342
After nine years ... 

707
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,928
 ... you know what I realize?

708
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,979
Ignorance is bliss.

709
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,861
Then we have a deal?

710
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,282
I don't want to remember nothing.

711
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,034
Nothing. You understand?

712
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,915
And I want to be rich.

713
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,961
You know, someone important.

714
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,589
Like an actor.

715
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,926
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

716
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,638
Okay.

717
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,433
I get my body
back in a power plant ... 

718
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,560
 ... you insert me into the Matrix ... 

719
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,312
 ... I'll get you what you want.

720
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,564
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

721
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,983
No. I told you, I don't know them.

722
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:09,946
I can get you the man who does.

723
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,490
Morpheus.

724
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,046
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

725
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:30,175
If you close your eyes, it almost feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

726
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,093
Yeah, or a bowl of snot.

727
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,220
Do you know what it really reminds me of?

728
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,391
Tasty Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tasty Wheat?

729
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,727
No, but technically,
neither did you.

730
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:43,021
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

731
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,648
Because you have to wonder now... 

732
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:48,151
 ... how do the machines really know
what Tasty Wheat tasted like?

733
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:49,819
Maybe they got it wrong.

734
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:53,281
Maybe what I think Tasty Wheat
tasted like, actually tasted like ... 

735
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,575
 ... oatmeal or tuna fish.

736
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,787
That makes you wonder about a lot of things.
You take chicken, for example.

737
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,039
Maybe they couldn't figure out
what to make chicken taste like ... 

738
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,333
 ... which is why chicken tastes
like everything.

739
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:05,377
- Maybe they couldn't figure out --
- Shut up, Mouse.

740
01:06:07,004 --> 01:06:08,463
It's a single-cell protein ... 

741
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,758
 ... combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

742
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:13,259
Everything the body needs.

743
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,388
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

744
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:22,227
So I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

745
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,313
You know, I wrote that program.

746
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:26,898
Here it comes.

747
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,109
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

748
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,529
The woman in the red dress?
I designed her.

749
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:35,615
She, uhm, well she doesn't talk very much ... 

750
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:39,828
 ... but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a much more personalized meeting.

751
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,454
Digital pimp, hard at work.

752
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:43,957
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

753
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,085
To deny our own impulses ... 

754
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,463
 ... is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

755
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,758
Dozer, when you're done ... 

756
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,552
 ... bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

757
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,470
We're going in.

758
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,597
Taking Neo to see her.

759
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,769
See who?

760
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,022
The Oracle.

761
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,070
Everyone please observe ... 

762
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:17,115
 ... the "fasten seat belt" and
"no smoking" signs have been turned on.

763
01:07:17,616 --> 01:07:20,994
Sit back and enjoy your ride.

764
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:46,436
We're in.

765
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,244
We'll be back in an hour.

766
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,011
Unbelievable ... 

767
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,596
 ... isn't it?

768
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:27,018
- God!
- What?

769
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:29,062
I used to eat there.

770
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:32,941
Really good noodles.

771
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,240
I have these memories from my life.

772
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,369
None of them happened.

773
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,329
What does that mean?

774
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,790
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

775
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:50,917
And the Oracle can?

776
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,585
That's different.

777
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,550
Did you go to her?

778
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,261
Yes.

779
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,138
What did she tell you?

780
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,892
She told me....

781
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,103
What?

782
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,233
We're here.

783
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,902
Neo, come with me.

784
01:09:37,882 --> 01:09:40,300
So is this the same oracle
that made ... 

785
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:41,718
 ... the prophecy?

786
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:46,306
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

787
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,766
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

788
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,396
And she knows what? Everything?

789
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,358
She would say she knows enough.

790
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:00,278
And she's never wrong.

791
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:05,658
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

792
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,577
She is a guide, Neo.

793
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:09,829
She can help you to find the path.

794
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,581
She helped you?

795
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,333
Yes.

796
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:15,418
What did she tell you?

797
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,089
That I would find the One.

798
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,355
I told you I can only
show you the door.

799
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:38,149
You have to walk through it.

800
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:43,029
Hello, Neo.

801
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,948
You're right on time.

802
01:10:52,873 --> 01:10:56,668
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

803
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,925
These are the other Potentials.

804
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:05,718
You can wait here.

805
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:49,095
Do not try and bend the spoon.

806
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,597
That's impossible.

807
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:56,436
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

808
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:58,354
What truth?

809
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:00,273
There is no spoon.

810
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,193
There is no spoon?

811
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:08,906
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

812
01:12:24,965 --> 01:12:26,424
The Oracle will see you now.

813
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,686
I know you're Neo.

814
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,480
Be right with you.

815
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,900
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

816
01:12:46,612 --> 01:12:49,489
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

817
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:52,700
Almost done.

818
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,829
Smell good, don't they?

819
01:12:58,082 --> 01:12:59,332
Yeah.

820
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,417
I'd ask you to sit down ... 

821
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:04,045
 ... but you're not going to anyway.

822
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,423
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

823
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:11,719
That vase.

824
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:13,721
I'm sorry.

825
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:15,848
I said don't worry about it.

826
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:18,976
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

827
01:13:19,603 --> 01:13:20,812
How did you know?

828
01:13:22,856 --> 01:13:26,651
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is ... 

829
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,946
 ... would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

830
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,661
You're cuter than I thought.

831
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,958
I can see why she likes you.

832
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:43,918
Who?

833
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,003
Not too bright, though.

834
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:52,385
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

835
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:55,680
So ... 

836
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,015
 ... what do you think?

837
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,602
Do you think you are the One?

838
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:04,605
Honestly, I don't know.

839
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,444
You know what that means?

840
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,446
It's Latin.

841
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,031
Means "Know thyself."

842
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:17,452
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.

843
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:23,541
Being the One is just
like being in love.

844
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,128
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it ... 

845
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:28,504
 ... through and through.

846
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:30,882
Balls to bones.

847
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:34,260
Well ... 

848
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:38,306
 ... I'd better have a look at you.

849
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,142
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

850
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,200
Okay ... .

851
01:14:57,826 --> 01:15:02,788
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but...."

852
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,415
Then you say...

853
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,292
But what?

854
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:10,505
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

855
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,884
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

856
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,513
You got the gift ... 

857
01:15:19,431 --> 01:15:21,724
 ... but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

858
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:27,438
What?

859
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,566
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

860
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,402
That's the way these things go.

861
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:36,864
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

862
01:15:40,327 --> 01:15:42,036
He, he almost had me convinced.

863
01:15:42,287 --> 01:15:43,412
I know.

864
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,083
Poor Morpheus.

865
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:52,588
Without him, we're lost.

866
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:56,300
What do you mean, "without him"?

867
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:02,223
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

868
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:07,186
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

869
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,065
And no one, not you, not even me ... 

870
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,568
 ... can convince him otherwise.

871
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:16,320
He believes it so blindly ... 

872
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:20,950
 ... that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

873
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,326
What?

874
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:25,162
You're going to
have to make a choice.

875
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:29,375
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

876
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:32,753
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

877
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:36,465
One of you is going to die.

878
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,846
Which one will be up to you.

879
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:45,141
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

880
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,059
You have a good soul.

881
01:16:48,145 --> 01:16:50,855
And I hate giving
good people bad news.

882
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,443
Oh, don't worry about it.

883
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:58,112
As soon as you
step outside that door ... 

884
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:00,489
 ... you'll start feeling better.

885
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:04,994
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

886
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:08,581
You're in control of your own life.

887
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:10,708
Remember?

888
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:13,586
Here ... 

889
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,006
 ... take a cookie.

890
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:20,885
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it ... 

891
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:24,221
 ... you'll feel right as rain.

892
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:34,774
What was said ... 

893
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,859
 ... was for you ... 

894
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:39,236
 ... and for you alone.

895
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,260
They're on the way.

896
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,125
What is that?

897
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,307
Whoa, déjà vu.

898
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:54,895
What did you just say?

899
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:56,647
Nothing. I just had
a little déjà vu.

900
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:58,524
- What did you see?
- What happened?

901
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:02,111
A black cat went past us ... 

902
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:03,988
 ...and then another that looked just like it.

903
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,781
How much like it, was it the same cat?

904
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,577
- Might have been, I'm not sure.
- Switch, Apoc.

905
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:14,874
What is it?

906
01:19:15,125 --> 01:19:19,545
A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.
It happens when they change something.

907
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:23,758
Oh, my God.

908
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:26,552
Let's go.

909
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:33,601
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

910
01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:40,316
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

911
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:23,067
That's what they changed.
We're trapped. There's no way out

912
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,194
Be calm. Give me your phone.

913
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:26,987
They'll be able to track it.

914
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,656
We have no choice.

915
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,283
Operator.

916
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:34,453
Tank. Find a structural drawing of
this building. Find it fast.

917
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:44,880
- Got it!
- I need the main wet-wall.

918
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:48,968
Eighth floor.

919
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,761
They're on the eighth floor.

920
01:20:51,054 --> 01:20:52,513
Switch, straight ahead.

921
01:20:53,265 --> 01:20:54,431
Neo ... .

922
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,690
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.

923
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:12,491
Then left. That's it.

924
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:13,826
Good.

925
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,837
Where are they?

926
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:26,440
Shh. They're in the walls.

927
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,068
They're in the walls!

928
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:52,132
It's an agent!

929
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:00,766
Morpheus!

930
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,184
You must get Neo out!

931
01:23:02,435 --> 01:23:04,269
He's all that matters!

932
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:06,772
- No. No, Morpheus! Don't!
- Trinity, go!

933
01:23:07,732 --> 01:23:09,066
Go!

934
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:17,241
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

935
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,350
Cypher, come on!

936
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:52,109
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

937
01:23:52,652 --> 01:23:53,777
And you are?

938
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,779
A Smith.

939
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:57,322
Agent Smith.

940
01:23:57,907 --> 01:23:59,950
You all look the same to me.

941
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:56,882
Take him.

942
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:04,973
No!

943
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,939
- Operator.
- Yeah, I need an exit, fast.

944
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,944
- Cypher?
- Yeah, there was an accident. Goddamn car accident.

945
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,071
All of a sudden, boom.

946
01:25:19,322 --> 01:25:20,697
Somebody up there still likes me.

947
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,199
I gotcha.

948
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,618
Get me out of here fast.

949
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:27,538
Intersection of Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

950
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:28,831
Right.

951
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,544
- Operator.
- Tank, it's me.

952
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:34,962
Is Morpheus alive?

953
01:25:35,338 --> 01:25:36,630
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

954
01:25:37,048 --> 01:25:38,966
Yes, they're moving him.
I don't know where to yet

955
01:25:39,175 --> 01:25:41,468
He's alive. We need an exit.

956
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:42,803
You're not far from Cypher.

957
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,221
- Cypher?
- I know.

958
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:46,557
- He's at Franklin and Erie.
- Got it.

959
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:56,859
Got him.

960
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:08,829
Where are they?

961
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,330
Making the call.

962
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,166
Good.

963
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:26,555
You first, Neo

964
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:30,976
Shit!

965
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:35,939
Tank!

966
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:37,733
No!

967
01:26:39,652 --> 01:26:41,820
I don't know. It just went dead.

968
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:09,848
Hello, Trinity.

969
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:11,600
Cypher? Where's Tank?

970
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,232
You know ... 

971
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:22,069
 ... for a long time ... 

972
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,156
 ... I thought I was in love with you.

973
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:28,992
I used to dream about you.

974
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,788
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

975
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:35,415
Too bad things had to
turn out this way.

976
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,000
You killed them.

977
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:39,002
- What?
- Oh, God.

978
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,671
I'm tired, Trinity.

979
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,966
I'm tired of this war ... 

980
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:47,094
 ...I'm tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship ... 

981
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:52,057
 ...being cold, eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

982
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,394
But most of all ... 

983
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:59,356
 ... I'm tired of that jack-off
and all of his bullshit.

984
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:01,775
Surprise, asshole!

985
01:28:02,318 --> 01:28:04,528
I bet you never saw this coming ... 

986
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:05,821
 ... did you?

987
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:10,492
God, I wish I could be there ... 

988
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:12,577
 ... when they break you.

989
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,790
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens ... 

990
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,209
 ... so right then ... 

991
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:20,794
 ... you'd know it was me.

992
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:22,462
You gave them Morpheus.

993
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,172
He lied to us, Trinity.

994
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:26,258
He tricked us!

995
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,802
If you had told us the truth ... 

996
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:31,930
 ... we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

997
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:34,308
That is not true, Cypher.
He set us free.

998
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:37,436
Free? You call this free?

999
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:42,357
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1000
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:46,862
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix ... 

1001
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:49,239
 ... I choose the Matrix.

1002
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:51,158
The Matrix isn't real.

1003
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:52,826
I disagree, Trinity.

1004
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:55,329
I think the Matrix ... 

1005
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:58,248
 ...could be more real than this world.

1006
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:02,919
All I do is pull the plug here.

1007
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:04,504
But there ... 

1008
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:07,341
 ... you have to watch Apoc die.

1009
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,593
Trinity.

1010
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:18,060
- Welcome to the real world, baby?
- But you're out, Cypher.

1011
01:29:18,311 --> 01:29:20,729
- You can't go back.
- Oh no, that's what you think.

1012
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,481
They're going to reinsert my body.

1013
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:26,360
I go back to sleep and when I wake up,
I won't remember a goddamn thing.

1014
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:27,611
By the way ... 

1015
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:30,822
 ... if you have anything terribly important
to say to Switch ... 

1016
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:32,407
 ...I suggest you say it now.

1017
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:35,702
- No, please don't.
- Not like this.

1018
01:29:37,413 --> 01:29:39,039
Not like this.

1019
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:44,544
Too late.

1020
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:46,588
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1021
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:48,715
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1022
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,967
I'm just the messenger.

1023
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:54,554
And right now, I'm going 
to prove it to you.

1024
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,307
If Morpheus was right ... 

1025
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,726
 ...Then there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1026
01:30:00,311 --> 01:30:01,812
I mean if Neo's the One ... 

1027
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:04,147
 ... then there'd have to be ... 

1028
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,983
 ... some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1029
01:30:07,151 --> 01:30:08,360
Right?

1030
01:30:08,986 --> 01:30:11,071
I mean, how can he be the One ... 

1031
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,322
 ... if he's dead?

1032
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:15,951
You never did answer me before ... 

1033
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:18,578
 ... if you bought into
Morpheus' bullshit.

1034
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:22,165
Come on, all I want
is a little yes or no.

1035
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:25,877
Look into his eyes ... 

1036
01:30:26,629 --> 01:30:28,130
 ... those big, pretty eyes ... 

1037
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:32,217
 ... tell me ... 

1038
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,177
 ... yes ... 

1039
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:35,887
 ... or no?

1040
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:38,723
- Yes.
- No!

1041
01:30:38,891 --> 01:30:40,058
I don't believe it.

1042
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:46,231
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still gonna to burn!

1043
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:05,876
You first.

1044
01:31:14,093 --> 01:31:16,386
- You're hurt.
- I'll be all right.

1045
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:20,348
Dozer?

1046
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:40,994
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1047
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:44,998
Marveled at its beauty ... 

1048
01:31:45,374 --> 01:31:47,626
 ... its genius?

1049
01:31:48,794 --> 01:31:50,670
Billions of people ... 

1050
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,673
 ... just living out their lives.

1051
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:56,384
Oblivious.

1052
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:03,850
Did you know that the first Matrix ... 

1053
01:32:04,101 --> 01:32:08,772
 ... was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered ... 

1054
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:12,192
 ... where everyone would be happy.

1055
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:14,236
It was a disaster.

1056
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:18,823
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1057
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:21,451
Some believe that ... 

1058
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:26,081
... we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1059
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:27,874
But I believe that ... 

1060
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:29,209
... as a species ... 

1061
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:33,296
... human beings define
their reality through misery ... 

1062
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:34,923
... and suffering.

1063
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:37,884
The perfect world would dream ... 

1064
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:42,973
 ... that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1065
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:47,978
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1066
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:49,938
The peak ... 

1067
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:51,606
 ... of your civilization.

1068
01:32:51,857 --> 01:32:54,109
I say, "your civilization" ... 

1069
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:58,488
 ... because as soon as we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization ... 

1070
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:01,825
 ... which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1071
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:05,745
Evolution, Morpheus.

1072
01:33:06,038 --> 01:33:07,372
Evolution.

1073
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,543
Like the dinosaur.

1074
01:33:13,713 --> 01:33:15,338
Look out that window.

1075
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:18,174
You had your time.

1076
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:22,804
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1077
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,515
The future is our time.

1078
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:30,937
There could be a problem.

1079
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:35,233
- What are they doing to him?
- Breaking into his mind.

1080
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:37,652
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1081
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:39,112
How much time?

1082
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:42,490
Depends on the mind.
Eventually, it will crack ... 

1083
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:47,162
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1084
01:33:47,413 --> 01:33:50,373
When it does, Morpheus tell them
anything they want to know.

1085
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:51,666
Well, What do they want?

1086
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:55,962
The leader of every ship is given
codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1087
01:33:56,213 --> 01:33:59,132
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe ... 

1088
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:02,469
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1089
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,888
Trinity, Zion's more important than me ... 

1090
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,222
 ... or you ... 

1091
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:07,682
 ... or even Morpheus.

1092
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:13,146
Well, there has to be
something we can do.

1093
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:15,565
There is. We pull the plug.

1094
01:34:18,653 --> 01:34:20,403
You're going to kill him?

1095
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:21,821
Kill Morpheus?

1096
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:24,074
We don't have a choice.

1097
01:34:30,873 --> 01:34:33,792
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1098
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:35,794
If the insider has failed ... 

1099
01:34:36,045 --> 01:34:39,255
 ... they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless --

1100
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,216
They're dead. In either case --

1101
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:45,011
We have no choice but to continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1102
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:46,346
Immediately.

1103
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:54,270
Morpheus, you're more
than a leader to us.

1104
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:57,440
You're our father.

1105
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:00,944
We'll miss you always.

1106
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,035
Stop!

1107
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:11,538
I don't believe this is happening.

1108
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,748
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1109
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:15,917
I don't know.

1110
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:18,712
- This can't be just coincidence. It can't be.
- What are you talking about?

1111
01:35:18,921 --> 01:35:20,171
The Oracle.

1112
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:22,215
She told me this would happen.

1113
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:26,803
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1114
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:28,471
What choice?

1115
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:33,977
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1116
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:36,646
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1117
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:40,483
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1118
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,652
There's no way that 
you're going back in.

1119
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:46,489
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I am something I'm not.

1120
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:49,033
What?

1121
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,369
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1122
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:54,706
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1123
01:35:54,957 --> 01:35:57,625
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1124
01:35:58,294 --> 01:35:59,544
No, Neo, that's not true.

1125
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:02,756
- It can't be true.
- Why?

1126
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:10,513
Neo, This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1127
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:15,143
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1128
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:20,356
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1129
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:22,192
That's what it looks like ... 

1130
01:36:22,359 --> 01:36:23,401
 ... but it's not.

1131
01:36:23,652 --> 01:36:26,029
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1132
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:30,825
Morpheus believed something, and he was 
ready to give his life for what he believed.

1133
01:36:31,076 --> 01:36:34,078
I understand that now.
But that's why I have to go.

1134
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:36,873
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1135
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,666
What?

1136
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:41,085
I believe I can bring him back.

1137
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,979
- What are you doing?
- I'm going with you.

1138
01:37:00,272 --> 01:37:02,273
- No, you're not.
- No?

1139
01:37:03,442 --> 01:37:05,568
Let me tell you what I believe.

1140
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,446
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1141
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:13,076
I believe if you were really serious about
saving him, you are going to need my help.

1142
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:15,370
And since I am the ranking officer on this ship ... 

1143
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:18,498
 ... if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1144
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:21,668
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1145
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:23,628
Tank ... 

1146
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:24,921
 ... load us up.

1147
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:37,851
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had ... 

1148
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,811
 ... during my time here.

1149
01:37:40,062 --> 01:37:44,065
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species ... 

1150
01:37:44,316 --> 01:37:46,568
 ...I realized ... 

1151
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:49,112
 ... that you're not actually mammals.

1152
01:37:51,323 --> 01:37:53,783
Every mammal on this planet ... 

1153
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:59,038
 ... instinctively develops a natural 
equilibrium with the surrounding environment.

1154
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,124
But you humans do not.

1155
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:05,211
You move to an area
and you multiply ... 

1156
01:38:05,462 --> 01:38:09,966
 ... and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1157
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:12,385
The only way you can survive ... 

1158
01:38:12,678 --> 01:38:15,638
 ... is to spread to another area.

1159
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:23,938
There is another organism
on this planet ... 

1160
01:38:24,189 --> 01:38:26,149
 ... that follows the same pattern.

1161
01:38:26,775 --> 01:38:28,443
Do you know what it is?

1162
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:30,653
A virus.

1163
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:35,033
Human beings are a disease.

1164
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:36,951
A cancer of this planet.

1165
01:38:37,202 --> 01:38:39,329
You are a plague.

1166
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,289
And we ... 

1167
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:42,832
 ... are the cure.

1168
01:38:43,834 --> 01:38:45,251
Okay, so what do you need?

1169
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,003
Besides a miracle.

1170
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:48,796
Guns.

1171
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:50,840
Lots of guns.

1172
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:01,935
Neo ... .

1173
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:06,230
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1174
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:09,359
That's why it's going to work.

1175
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:15,365
Why isn't the serum working?

1176
01:39:15,991 --> 01:39:18,284
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1177
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:21,621
Leave me with him.

1178
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:25,333
Now.

1179
01:39:36,553 --> 01:39:38,137
Hold on, Morpheus.

1180
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:41,099
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1181
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,603
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1182
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:48,523
I'm going to be honest ... 

1183
01:39:48,899 --> 01:39:50,108
 ... with you.

1184
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:55,905
I ... 

1185
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:57,907
 ... hate ... 

1186
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,118
 ... this place ... 

1187
01:40:00,452 --> 01:40:02,745
 ... this zoo ... 

1188
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,122
 ... this prison ... 

1189
01:40:04,373 --> 01:40:07,542
 ... this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1190
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:10,086
I can't stand it any longer.

1191
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,714
It's the smell.

1192
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,967
If there is such a thing.

1193
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:19,595
I feel saturated by it.

1194
01:40:21,098 --> 01:40:22,390
I can ... 

1195
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:24,183
 ... taste ... 

1196
01:40:24,351 --> 01:40:26,394
 ... your stink.

1197
01:40:26,645 --> 01:40:30,273
And every time I do, I feel I have 
somehow been infected by it.

1198
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:31,441
It's repulsive.

1199
01:40:32,443 --> 01:40:33,818
Isn't it?

1200
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:38,281
I must get out of here.

1201
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:40,908
I must get free.

1202
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,037
And in this mind is the key.

1203
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:45,955
My key.

1204
01:40:46,206 --> 01:40:49,083
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1205
01:40:49,334 --> 01:40:50,960
Don't you understand?

1206
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:52,628
I need the codes.

1207
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,214
I have to get inside Zion ... 

1208
01:40:55,549 --> 01:40:58,051
 ... and you have to tell me how.

1209
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:00,344
You're going to tell me ... 

1210
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:02,764
 ... or you're going to die.

1211
01:41:22,951 --> 01:41:26,079
Would you please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1212
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,042
Holy shit!

1213
01:41:43,138 --> 01:41:45,848
Backup. Send backup.

1214
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:10,790
Freeze!

1215
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:26,842
What were you doing?

1216
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:29,971
He doesn't know.

1217
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:31,722
Know what?

1218
01:44:59,793 --> 01:45:02,295
I think they're trying to save him.

1219
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:18,894
There is no spoon.

1220
01:45:48,508 --> 01:45:50,676
Find them and destroy them!

1221
01:45:52,304 --> 01:45:54,138
I repeat, we're under attack!

1222
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:27,421
Trinity!

1223
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:29,006
Help!

1224
01:46:51,029 --> 01:46:52,238
Only human.

1225
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:54,281
Dodge this.

1226
01:47:07,504 --> 01:47:09,004
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1227
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:13,342
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1228
01:47:14,469 --> 01:47:15,845
Wasn't fast enough.

1229
01:47:18,598 --> 01:47:19,890
Can you fly that thing?

1230
01:47:21,017 --> 01:47:22,017
Not yet.

1231
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:26,355
Operator.

1232
01:47:26,565 --> 01:47:29,733
Tank, I need a pilot program
for a B-212 helicopter.

1233
01:47:30,193 --> 01:47:31,485
Hurry.

1234
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:41,036
Let's go.

1235
01:47:56,136 --> 01:47:57,219
No.

1236
01:48:48,813 --> 01:48:51,440
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1237
01:49:29,479 --> 01:49:30,521
He's not going to make it.

1238
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:41,365
Gotcha.

1239
01:50:47,432 --> 01:50:48,599
Trinity!

1240
01:51:30,266 --> 01:51:31,684
I knew it.

1241
01:51:32,310 --> 01:51:33,519
He's the One.

1242
01:51:49,494 --> 01:51:51,704
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1243
01:51:54,582 --> 01:51:55,749
Morpheus ... .

1244
01:51:57,419 --> 01:51:58,502
The Oracle.

1245
01:51:59,754 --> 01:52:02,131
- She told me I'm--
- She told you... 

1246
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:04,091
 ...exactly what you needed to hear.

1247
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:05,718
That's all.

1248
01:52:06,761 --> 01:52:09,722
Neo, sooner or later you're going 
to realize, just as I did ... 

1249
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:12,349
 ... there's a difference
between knowing the path ... 

1250
01:52:13,101 --> 01:52:14,393
 ... and walking the path.

1251
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:18,647
- Operator.
- Tank.

1252
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:22,109
- It's good to hear your voice, Sir.
- We need an exit.

1253
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:25,154
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1254
01:52:38,209 --> 01:52:40,627
- Damn it!
- The trace was completed.

1255
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:44,465
- We have their position.
- The Sentinels are standing by.

1256
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:47,676
Order the strike.

1257
01:52:54,225 --> 01:52:56,226
They're not out yet.

1258
01:53:07,405 --> 01:53:08,739
You first, Morpheus.

1259
01:53:29,427 --> 01:53:31,720
Neo, I want to tell you something ... 

1260
01:53:34,974 --> 01:53:38,936
 ... but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

1261
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:45,818
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1262
01:53:48,571 --> 01:53:50,113
Everything but this.

1263
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,658
But what?

1264
01:54:17,559 --> 01:54:18,725
Neo!

1265
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:20,602
- What the hel just happened?
- An agent.

1266
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:22,771
- You have to send me back.
- I can't.

1267
01:54:24,816 --> 01:54:26,775
Mr. Anderson.

1268
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:30,362
Run, Neo. Run.

1269
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:37,286
What is he doing?

1270
01:54:37,537 --> 01:54:38,787
He's beginning to believe.

1271
01:55:05,773 --> 01:55:07,149
You're empty.

1272
01:55:07,734 --> 01:55:09,026
So are you.

1273
01:55:42,185 --> 01:55:45,187
I'm going to enjoy watching you die ... 

1274
01:55:46,314 --> 01:55:47,356
 ... Mr. Anderson.

1275
01:56:28,314 --> 01:56:30,399
Jesus, he's killing him.

1276
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:58,695
Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1277
01:57:59,447 --> 01:58:02,449
That is the sound of inevitability.

1278
01:58:05,036 --> 01:58:08,371
That is the sound of your death.

1279
01:58:09,290 --> 01:58:11,625
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1280
01:58:11,876 --> 01:58:13,502
My name ... 

1281
01:58:16,506 --> 01:58:18,548
 ... is Neo.

1282
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:52,999
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1283
01:58:55,503 --> 01:58:56,545
Oh, shit.

1284
01:59:08,933 --> 01:59:10,392
Sentinels.

1285
01:59:11,144 --> 01:59:13,395
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1286
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:17,607
Tank, charge the EMP.

1287
01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:20,902
- you can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1288
01:59:22,071 --> 01:59:23,155
He's gonna make it.

1289
01:59:23,406 --> 01:59:25,282
Flat or pumps? No, just --

1290
01:59:25,533 --> 01:59:28,410
What the -? Shit, that's my phone!

1291
01:59:28,828 --> 01:59:30,412
That guy took my phone!

1292
01:59:32,790 --> 01:59:35,083
Got him! He's on the run.

1293
01:59:35,334 --> 01:59:38,003
Mr. Wizard, get me the hell out of here!

1294
01:59:38,254 --> 01:59:40,130
Got a patch on an old exit.
Wabash and Lake.

1295
01:59:44,093 --> 01:59:45,093
Oh, shit!

1296
02:00:06,657 --> 02:00:08,658
Help! Need a little help!

1297
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:11,494
The door.

1298
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:28,970
The door on your left.

1299
02:00:29,889 --> 02:00:31,139
No, your other left!

1300
02:00:37,855 --> 02:00:39,105
Back door.

1301
02:00:59,877 --> 02:01:01,002
Oh, no.

1302
02:01:02,672 --> 02:01:04,172
Here they come.

1303
02:01:32,952 --> 02:01:34,202
He's going to make it.

1304
02:01:44,422 --> 02:01:47,549
Fire escape at the end
of the alley, room 303.

1305
02:02:22,668 --> 02:02:23,752
They're inside.

1306
02:02:26,088 --> 02:02:27,130
Hurry, Neo.

1307
02:03:23,354 --> 02:03:24,479
Can't be.

1308
02:03:32,279 --> 02:03:33,655
Check him.

1309
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:39,202
He's gone.

1310
02:03:45,918 --> 02:03:48,336
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1311
02:03:55,928 --> 02:03:56,970
Neo ... .

1312
02:03:58,431 --> 02:04:00,390
I'm not afraid anymore.

1313
02:04:02,017 --> 02:04:03,351
The Oracle told me ... 

1314
02:04:03,519 --> 02:04:08,940
 ...that I would fall in love, and that
that man, the man that I loved would be the One.

1315
02:04:12,069 --> 02:04:14,028
And so you see ... 

1316
02:04:14,738 --> 02:04:16,739
 ... you can't be dead.

1317
02:04:18,325 --> 02:04:20,160
You can't be ... 

1318
02:04:21,704 --> 02:04:23,872
 ... because I love you.

1319
02:04:25,708 --> 02:04:27,417
You hear me?

1320
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:30,211
I love you.

1321
02:04:53,944 --> 02:04:55,236
Now get up.

1322
02:05:03,913 --> 02:05:05,079
No.

1323
02:05:31,815 --> 02:05:32,857
How?

1324
02:05:33,734 --> 02:05:34,776
He is the One.

1325
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:02,989
Neo!

1326
02:07:59,254 --> 02:08:00,963
I know you're out there.

1327
02:08:01,215 --> 02:08:03,049
I can feel you now.

1328
02:08:03,467 --> 02:08:07,095
I know that you're afraid.
You're afraid of us.

1329
02:08:07,429 --> 02:08:09,263
You're afraid of change.

1330
02:08:10,724 --> 02:08:12,058
I don't know the future.

1331
02:08:12,226 --> 02:08:14,811
I didn't come here to tell you
how this is going to end.

1332
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:18,022
I came here to tell you
how it's going to begin.

1333
02:08:18,982 --> 02:08:20,566
I'm going to hang up this phone.

1334
02:08:20,818 --> 02:08:23,903
And then I'm going to show these people
what you don't want them to see.

1335
02:08:24,154 --> 02:08:26,030
I'm going to show them a world ... 

1336
02:08:26,281 --> 02:08:28,032
 ... without you.

1337
02:08:28,325 --> 02:08:31,953
A world without rules and controls,
without borders or boundaries.

1338
02:08:32,204 --> 02:08:35,915
A world where anything is possible.

1339
02:08:38,544 --> 02:08:39,877
Where we go from there ... 

1340
02:08:40,129 --> 02:08:42,088
 ... is a choice I leave to you.

1341
02:09:25,594 --> 02:09:33,594
